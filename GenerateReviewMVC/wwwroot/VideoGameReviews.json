That day was almost entirely spent in a haze, as I swung my Keyblade about like it was 2002 again. But good chunks of that game bored me to tears, with its glacially slow start, repetitive missions, and the baffling inability to run around The World That Never Was save for the bland hub room you spend your time in. What I did like was the fun tile system and the story, which is by far the most tragic in the series. Re:Coded was fun but suffered from the most recycling in series history, where even the new areas have been copy/pasted into later areas.\nFast Forward to 2013, and I bought a secondhand 3DS with which to play Pokemon X/Y, and the first order of business was to acquire a copy of KH 3D, or KH DDD if you're a pervert. I open my copy and sail away (literally). After the game's completely unexplained first fight (against Ursula of all people), the game immediately hit the brakes and spends the next hour and a half boring you to tears with explanations of systems you already understand in another version of Traverse Town.\nHowever, once the game remembers that you can figure things on your own, the game plays it's Get Out of Boredom Free card and shows you the doorway into a brand new set of areas for Traverse Town, and from then on, very little of your surroundings have been copied from past games.\nFlowmotion, a pink-colored mode of transport that fits the series like a glove, lets you go anywhere from the onset, but is difficult to get a hang of. This complements the old Command List combat and the new Dream Eater party members. They are the only way to get key abilities, so pay attention. Also new is the Drop system, in which a gauge steadily depletes, at which point you are forced to swap between the two separate protagonists, Sora and Riku. It makes for a new form of tension, as you manage both your health and your Drop gauge (via new items) in order to defeat bosses.\nThe story is the usual mix of completely, ass-kickingly awesome, PhD levels of convoluted-ness, and manly tears. Riku has the lion's share of both character development and play time, and his arc (involving him owning up to his past and the darkness inside him) is the one to beat. Sora's story is still fun to watch, though I'd like to see him grow up a little. The end (and the unlockable secret movie) teases the incoming Kingdom Hearts III, and the credits literally spells out \"This leads to Kingdom Hearts III\" during the credits.

Siddiqui", "reviewText": "It's been ten years since the Keyblade warrior Sora first took arms into the battle between light, dark, and nothingness. When Kingdom Hearts was first released in 2002 on the Playstation 2 players were able to travel through iconic Disney worlds and encounter the popular characters from not only Disney franchises but Final Fantasy series as well. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance marks the return of Sora and Riku as they attempt to become Keyblade masters. Although the story is difficult to follow and some plot points remain unanswered Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is an excellent action-adventure title that utilizes the comedic dialogue, fast pace action, and memorable characters that has made this series so popular.\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts: Recoded and follows the franchises most significant characters, Sora and his best friend Riku, as they attempt to pass the Mark of Mastery exam. You will take control of both characters and switch between the two in time intervals called drops. Both Sora and Riku must save parallel versions of seven different worlds in only to become true Keyblade Masters in order to defeat Xehanort. Kingdom Hearts 3D remains loyal to the concepts that made this franchise great such as notorious Disney worlds to explore, appearances by Final Fantasy characters, and a strong focus on light and darkness. If you played other games on the franchise you'll be able to put up the story quickly, however if you are new then you will have to read a lot of text and probably look up information pertaining to the various flashbacks. However as a person who has played Kingdom Hearts I still found the story difficult to follow due to pacing issues that was probably used to catapult the story forward into Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nUnfortunately the exam doesn't go as plan and another villain seeks to control the light in Kingdom Hearts. Throughout your journey you'll experience flashbacks, visions of the future, and memorable characters. Each stage you venture into has been tailored from Disney films, such as classic movies like Fantasia and modern ones like Tron: Legacy. Within each stage you will solve problems from the movie's plot while getting one step closer to your own goal. As wonderfully animated as these stages are they offer limited exploration and most of the time you will follow a linear path. Don't expect a lot of side quests, but a card game can be played at certain places. Experiencing each nostalgic event is complemented with fantastic music that suits the environment and the battles that ensue.\n\nEach world is populated with a diverse amount of enemies known as dream eaters. These creatures appear randomly throughout each environment and have unique abilities. Although you only control Riku or Sora you can tame dream eaters to fight alongside you by collecting fragments hidden in treasure chest, loot from fallen enemies, or purchasing them from shops. You can create these creatures by either using recipes or just randomly putting things together.  To upgrade these creatures you earn points in battle and each dream eater comes with its own special attack that adds novelty to collecting them. Another option allows the player to personally manage your creature by providing actions of affection by using the touch pad causing different rewards and a lovely animation as they leap with joy.\n\nAlthough your dream eaters are valuable companions Sora and Riku will do most of the fighting. Returning is the command deck system from Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep. Players will be able to collect and equip abilities and magical talents for quick access. Sora and Riku will have access to offensive magical attacks, healing spells, special attacks, and other appealing abilities that are gained through battle. After using these specific powers a cool down period is initiated, forcing players to rely on careful planning before battles instead of spamming the same move.\n\nA new ability known as flow motion allows Sora and Riku to quickly navigate the environment. To activate this luminous ability you simply interact with the environment or enemies, allowing with quick movements such as grinding on rails, hopping on walls, swinging on poles, and spinning enemies around. Not only is these great for evading enemy attacks but within this state a specific set of attacks become available, even better is that these attacks or flow motion itself doesn't have a cool down period. Players will easily get addicted to pulling off the visually and destructive appeal of these abilities. However at time these mechanics is unresponsive on certain objects.\n\nAnother new system known as the drop system forces you to switch between Sora and Riku. After a certain amount of time as passed players will be forced into the drop system to play as Sora or Riku and continue their overlapping story. This system can get vexing as players are forced to stop one objective for another, but you can extend the period before another drop by using Drop-Me-Not. Some may find these vexing but it forces players to play both stories without ignoring one over another.\n\nWhile you will be fighting and talking for most of your venture, minigames are introduced to break up the pace. Visiting a new world for the first time you are put into a dive that allows you to collect stars and defeat enemies similar to an on-rail shooter. Fans of Tron will enjoy the light cycle battles, hacking computers with the touch pad, and unscramble words. The 3D itself may not be the best on the system but it does allow for excellent depth-of-field within battles, minigames, and cutscenes.\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D is a wonderful addition to the franchise. Despite its problems the combat, characters, and music remain the same stellar quality that is expected. It's unfortunate that the story doesn't share the same quality as the characters themselves, but humor and charm overshadow these difficulties for the most part. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is a befitting return of Sora and Riku.", "summary": "Ten years later and still strong", "unixReviewTime": 1363996800}

Why? Well, as much as I loved those games, I was disappointed in the fact that they mostly took me back to worlds I'd already been to sometime before. With this game, however, there were new worlds to explore that I couldn't wait to get to(namely the Tron: Legacy world). Not only that KH3D introduced new play mechanics into the series, the Flowmotion combat(which allows players to utilize the environment to dodge enemies as well as execute special attacks) & the Drop system(which makes you switch between Sora and Riku's separate yet overlapping storylines after a certain amount of playtime has passed). This new system proves to be a welcome addition to the series. The Command Deck system(most of you know)from Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep makes a welcome return in this game, it allows players to collect and equip different abilities for easy access in battle.\n\nHate to admit it, folks, but I believe this has to be my most favorite game of all out of the series. As always, the game looks absolutely stunning(but now in 3D). Course, the game still suffers from problems that plagued it in past games; such as a faulty camera, controlling how your character moves and, as always, the narrative(story) being confusing at times. Despite those quibbles, KH3D is still quite fun and enjoyable. The game meets, if not surpasses, the quality of the console games and everything that has come before it.\n\nNow, Square-Enix, bring on the next console entry before the PS3 gets too old, okay?

I been a fan boy of kingdom hearts since that christmas 10 or so years ago when my dad got me a PS2 and Kingdom Hearts and I was amazed at the opening sequence. It was a game i remember fully to this day and I remember having the time of my life playing!\n\nSince that one game I have played every single Kingdom Hearts game, Birth by Sleep being my favorite as it was the best with story telling (358/2 was my second pick) I admit I knew recoded wasn't gonna be anything special but I went into it and enjoyed it nonetheless and yeah it wasn't birth by sleep but it was fun and got me excited for the game i brought my 3ds for \"kingdom hearts 3d\".\nMaybe the fact that I started playing KH when I was 12 and now im 22 has something to do with it. Maybe the fact that my memory isn't as good anymore (I have to take vitamins for memory problems so remembering the WHOLE KH plot is a hassle). But I just could not get into this game. I heartbrokenly told my girlfriend how disappointed how I kept trying to get into the game but man it was so cheesy and repetitive. If I had to hear Sora talk about friendship and its importance one more time I would shoot myself. Thats all this kid cares about, the magical power of friendship? Don't get me wrong I understand friendship is a BIG plot to KH as a whole but every level Sora wants to be friends with everyone and the levels end the same way with Sora talking about the power of friendship....\nI didn't mind the dream eaters like most people did. they were kinda cute and I liked the link system although I wished it was more like final fantasy tens (oh yeah btw what happened to ANY final fantasy character?? did they all die or something). I did wish the dream eaters were replaced by heartless and Sora was once again with Donald and goofy but im guessing thats what kingdom hearts 3 will be for!\n\nBut yup I couldn't even finish this game. I sold it to gamestop and it went towards my wii u... for the very first time I couldn't finish a KH game...\n\nPlease don't just give this review negative reviews just out of spite as I am a fan boy just like many of yourselves and I still LOVE KH as a whole but I just couldn't get into this game like so many others did. Taking 8 tries to beat a boss on proud mode only to be \"Dropped\" when you almost have him defeated, to return to the battle all over again, also was a bi**h. it happened a few times and was pretty\nannoying.\n\nI will still have faith for KH 3 and hopefully im not let down!!", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dumb Dull Diabolical", "unixReviewTime": 1353888000}

You don't have to worry about that with KH:3D because it fills you in and brings you up to speed from past to present. If you aren't a fan of Kingdom Hearts games, you might not like this (because its Kingdom Hearts), but if you are open to the adventure in a more portable form, give it a whirl. Its not like the DS versions where cut scenes were still images, there are cut scenes... just consider the adventure being continued from KH:2 on the PS2, along with some very cool additions.\n\nWhat additions you ask? Well, there is the obvious addition of 3D (which has a beautifully amazing intro, you have to see it), but there is the added element of Dream Eaters as well. I didn't know what role the dream eaters would play in the game, until I played the demo (there is a demo, so check it out, but it isn't a full world like the one in the game, and the build is structured for the demo).\n\nThere are good & bad dream eaters, and of course you utilize the good ones, but you can also collect them via physical dream eater cards, or from crafting various elements in the game. Dream eaters are able to level up just like you, and you are able to enjoy various activities with them beyond the main adventure, one of which is a card game (called \"Flick Rush\") where you select 3 of your dream eaters to go into an area style battle versus other players or the CPU. You don't use the dream eaters at the same time.... think Pokemon, except its a bit more on the fast paced side of things.\n\nYou will learn, that it's not all about being quick on the draw, you need strategy, and you literally need to pick and choose your attacks wisely because you have to defend at times too. I am a fan of strategy, so this adds to what KH:3D has, and its not predictable (especially with the ability to battle anyone willing to take you on).\n\nI would literally hold a tournament for that card battle aspect, because you use the dream eaters you've created and leveled up. You give them various items during creation to improve their attributes also, which can help a dream eater with a weakness improve its durability against such a weakness (for example). Its really interesting.\n\nOn the adventure side, based on the way I've leveled up my dream eaters (and continue to level them up), they've pulled me out of some sticky situations, and I've literally learned to use them strategically where one provides health, while another provides a shield, etc. There is also a way for you to link up with your dream eaters, whether individually, or combine them together to either merge with you (the 3 of you together), or for you to ride upon as you pack a wallop with a stronger than average attack (I prefer some more than others, but I haven't experienced them all yet).\n\nSound like there is a lot to the game? That's because there is, and you have your own techniques and attacks for your characters (you will play with 2 throughout the adventure), but I will let you check those out.\n\nThings that I haven't had the pleasure of enjoying yet are:\n\n* I have NOT played 2 player co-op or versus\n\n* Street Pass interaction\n\n* Circle Pad Pro\n\nCons:\n\nAlthough it will likely not be a con to everyone, and isn't a con all the time....... swaps between characters will boost your sense of urgency to get something done asap. At times it can have you on the edge of your seat, and at times you don't want to be forced to switch to the other character because of the drop. It can be avoided temporarily by buying a certain item, or making certain moves successfully, but it merely increases your time before the inevitable drop (which puts you to sleep and goes back to the other character). What's good though is that you are not taken back to some sort of check point, you literally begin where you left off... whether its roaming one of the worlds for items, and treasure, kicking butt, or getting yours handed to you.\n\nYou will likely get use to the drop though, and will become adjusted to continuing where you left off. Since the story intertwines things, you aren't sent off in two different directions wondering how in the world they connect, enjoy the story though so that you aren't scratching your head in regards to the story-line (skipping scenes, and other material is optional, so its your choice if you want to fly through your investment). I'm not a spoiler kind of guy so the review is coming to a close, but I consider it money well spent.\n\n- \"Nintendo-Demand\" (Facebook & Google+)\n\nP.S.- If you are unfamiliar with Kingdom Hearts games, play the demo.... this includes anyone that doesn't like Kingdom Hearts and is interested in trying KH:3D.

Every time you unlock something, the game will show a card with lots of info on it. Too much to read, as it takes about a good 30 seconds to actually grasp and memorize what the card says.\nAs a result, most people just click it away, and try to discover that info by themselves, often frustrating themselves, because they can't find a certain portal or move, or defeat a certain weapon, because they did not read the info on the card.\n\nOtherwise it's a nice game, but takes lots of your time. It's definitely nothing that you want to play just to fill up 5 minutes of your time.\nIt's the type that you play when you know you got the whole day ahead of you, and just want to lie in the couch, getting rid of your boring life!\n\nI would recommend it to other people, just like Zelda or Mario Kart!", "summary": "More Japanese anime like than disney like!", "unixReviewTime": 1347148800}

I'm still playing the game since that day. I'm currently 43 hours into the game on Proud mode with 38% of the story completed. Hence, you can tell I am taking my sweet time with the game unlike other people, who just rush through it for the story. I've played all of the localized released KH games, except for re:coded (which was originally a cell phone game). Birth by Sleep was my favorite game out of the KH series, but I think Dream Drop Distance can sit right next to it.\n\nStory: A Dream? -----\n\nI probably don't have to repeat it here as it's been posted, said and repeated a million times, but whatever...\n\nYou get that the story's gist is: Sora and Riku must enter the dreams of seven sleeping worlds as a part of their Mark of Mastery exam in order to become full-fledged keyblade masters. However, a mysterious boy shows up trying to \"incept\" the exam and throw some riddles at both of them. Who he is and why he resembles Xehanort when he was a young boy, we'll find out eventually at the end. In the world of the waking, everything may seem fine on their end, but they're not....??  Remember this: \"Darkness becomes light and light falls into darkness.\"\n\nIf you're a KH newbie, there are Chronicle entries that you can read in this game, that are unlocked as you go through it, explaining to you what happened in the previous KH games. Unlike other game series out there, KH is one big continuous storyline ala Harry Potter. So, you'll come across a plot point that won't be answered until a future game. I highly recommend you guys to Google the \"KH Info Block\", because that Tumblr explains certain plot details a little better than the Chronicles. The Chronicles are still alright for giving you guys a good gist of the story. If you ever think about playing some of the past KH games, go in release order. You can try the official timeline order, but things work out better, both story and gameplay-wise, in release order.\n\n(Out of all the KH games, re:coded holds the least importance to the story so you can skip that one if you want, and watch the ending cutscenes on Youtube.)\n\nFor KH fans/veterans, the story pacing has improved a lot from its early days of KH1, CoM and 2. It is also paced a little differently than Birth by Sleep, because you're dealing with two characters who battle in separate identical worlds instead of three characters trying to find one another in three separate storylines. Overall though, Dream Drop Distance works almost just like Birth by Sleep, but you're playing the two storylines at the same time. You no longer have to switch out of one character's file just to go to another character's file. That's why the Drop system exists for that purpose, however, I'll get into that a little later.\n\nIn each world, you won't find NPCs, except for Moogles and a particular Dream Eater, that you can simply walk up to and talk to them. All of the NPC conversations are in cutscenes, but they can be replayed again in the Flashback section of your Momentos menu.\n\nGoing back to DDD's pacing a bit, each world makes you go on a \"mini quest\" to do something for the NPCs who live there. Thus, it is a different type of interactive feel compared to trying to find a button behind a wall in Cinderella's house. However, each world holds a moral/theme that's actually important enough that both Sora and Riku keep reflecting on them. Some people seem to not look at Sora and Riku's thoughts/feelings. They just see the Disney worlds as they are calling them \"filler\", but they're not. You'll also be \"interrupted\" by someone, or some people, in each world that is/are related to the story's main villain, Xehanort. After beating each world, you'll see the other half of the story as to what's going on in the waking world. If you've seen the trailers, you can kind of picture how the beginning of that portion unfolds.\n\nThe System -----\n\nLike the previous KH games, you are offered three different difficulty levels: Beginner, Standard, and Proud. If you complete Proud mode, then, you can unlock Critical mode. I highly recommend Proud mode. It's an improvement mode over Birth by Sleep, where the Unversed there were very easy to triumph over after just leveling up a few levels. In other words, there was a lack of a need to grind in Birth by Sleep throughout most of the game. That was the main disappointing thing in BbS that I had an issue with. However, in Dream Drop Distance, we can grind once more with enemies that are push overs.\n\nFor the two 3DS screens, the top shows your gameplay and cutscenes. The bottom screen functions as a world's map (which can be enlarged or shrunk), access to setting up a Link portal, checking up on what you need to do (via story), interacting with the Link ability system, and doing any Dream Eater training related activity.\n\nThe menu system, itself, is just like the previous KH games, but probably the most similar to the Birth by Sleep menu system. What's new about it is the Momentos section, which I already explained above. In that section, you can view past cutscenes, tutorials and other review type of information. Very easy to read and digest.\n\nThe camera system works the same way the first Kingdom Hearts game worked, but a little more stable where it does follow your character around more. You use the L and R buttons to pivot the camera, but I don't really use it so much. Some people think the camera follows the character too closely, but it's not that big of an issue to me.\n\nGameplay and Monsters Galore -----\n\nOne good chunk of the physical gameplay relies on \"Flowmotion\" where you parkour off walls, lightpoles, stair railings, strings of light, etc. and etc. It's a little bit of what some people would call, \"the battle system on crack\". You can even use it to scale up buildings such as Notre Dame. However, it's not invincible against enemies. Some of the enemies will be able to interrupt your Flowmotion with their own attacks. So, you can't always rely on it for everything.  If you ever do feel that Flowmotion is overpowering you, you do have the option to turn it off in the menu. However for me, I'm completely fine with it as it's fun to use and makes traveling through the big worlds much easier. You'll also be able to unlock the normal platforming abilities in this game. How you choose to use both systems are all up to you. You have the option to turn off abilities in your Command menu section.\n\nUpdate 1: Sorry, forgot one thing. Reality Shift.  It's a system that involves both the air and the ground. When you're near Dream Eaters and objects, like barrels, a group of flashing pinkish/purpleish arrows show up. Slide down your stylus and you activate Reality Shift. There are different Reality Shifts per world each fitted to that world's theme. You might find some of them to be helpful when dealing with bosses and hordes of DEs.\n\nThe amount of Commands are less in Dream Drop Distance than in Birth by Sleep, but they still pack a punch. It seems that Square Osaka (- Square-Enix's division in the western part of Japan, who made Birth by Sleep -) were able to pick out some of the popular ones from BbS into Dream Drop Distance. At the same time, they invented some new Commands, which are just as awesome. Unlike Birth by Sleep, you don't level up these Commands. What you have to level up, besides Sora and Riku, are your Dream Eaters. In Birth by Sleep, you had Shot-locks and Dual Linking. In DDD, the same can still be seen when you link up with your Dream Eater. Certain Dream Eater abilities look exactly like Shot-locking. Just minus the target icon.\n\nDream Eaters are indeed cute and colorful looking residents of the dreaming universe. There are two kinds of Dream Eaters. The ones that are good are called \"Spirits\". The bad ones are known as \"Nightmares\". Despite their appearances, the enemy Dream Eaters do get really powerful and menacing if you're not too careful. Their A.I.s are MUCH better than Donald and Goofy's so that's how good they are to you. Sometimes, I would let them battle some DEs for me in order to succeed in a \"Special Portal\", where I'm not allowed to get hit more than two times. (Portals will be explained later.)\n\nYou're responsible for taking care of your Dream Eaters in order to level them and their abilities, up. Taking care of them are similar to Nintendogs/cats \"petting the pet\" effect, but these rubs and pokes are effective towards your Dream Eaters' Link Points and EXP as well. For a certain number of pokes and rubs you do on a Dream Eater, you can change their \"Disposition\" levels in order to unlock new abilities. What's amusing about these Dream Eaters, they each have their own personalities. Some are very happy, while others can be very moody and are easily prone to anger management problems. The pickier Dream Eaters can be harder to train.\n\nYou can also play a few mini-games with the Dream Eaters that go into their EXP level.  The only slight downside for some people with the Dream Eaters are: if you switch a Dream Eater out of your party for a different DE, you lose all the resistance abilities (i.e. Dark Screen) that you gained with that particular DE. If you want them back, all you have to do is switch that DE back into your party. Despite saying all that, Sora/Riku can do pretty well with a lack of resistance abilities on hand. It doesn't bother me one bit, at least. For some other people, they just want to keep that resistance level all the way through, regardless of the Dream Eater they have in their party.\n\nSpeaking of Dream Eater resistance abilities, you'll be leveling up your Dream Eater through an Ability Link status matrix grid system. The more Ability Link points your Dream Eater gains while fighting against other Dream Eaters, the more abilities you can unlock on the matrix grid.\n\nIn Birth by Sleep, you level up Commands and fuse them together with a crystal in order to get a new Command. In DDD, you mix Dream Eater ingredients with Commands in order to create new Dream Eaters. So, the process of combining something with something else is still there. You're just not required to constantly level up new Commands to level 3 or 4. Leveling up newly acquired Dream Eaters have taken that place. You may also not be using all 50 Dream Eaters, however, in order to gain one of the completion trophies, you will need to make all 50 Dream Eaters. Before you can even make a Dream Eater, you will need to find that Dream Eater's recipe scattered about in the seven worlds.\n\nDrop System -----\n\nThe other main component of the game's system is the Drop System, which makes you switch between Sora and Riku in intervals of 20 minutes each. There's a bonus countdown that kicks in towards the end of your Drop gauge where you can get extra items from enemies. That's if you choose to do it by any means.\n\nWhen the game first came out in Japan, I was completely worried about this because I had nightmares of time limit gameplays with Majora's Mask. Even some of the Japanese fans were ripping it apart. I am seriously NOT a fan of time limits. I love taking my time and exploring the worlds of games. I could tolerate them in Birth by Sleep, but something like Majora's Mask's three day system (which can be countered by a song) was scary.\n\nHowever, to my pleasant surprise, it's very very veeery easy to counter the Drop system with items that you can buy early on in the game starting at the affordable price of 40 munny. (You can buy up to 99 of them so you have plenty of time to spare.) One such item is the one in my subject line, \"Drop-Me-Not\", which resets your Drop counter one-two bars back. In the future portion of the game, you can also purchase a \"Drop-Me-Never\", which completely resets your Drop counter back to however it started.\n\nAnother way to elongate your time is by obtaining Drop Points that you get when you fight enemy Dream Eaters. During the process of \"Dropping\", you'll be shown a menu of choices that affect the character that you'll be switch to. One of these choices is a \"Drop Decelerator\", which slows down your Drop gauge in three different speeds. The more Drop Points you obtain, the easier chances you can obtain the highest level of the Decelerator.\n\nThus, I encourage you guys to spend a lot of time per character/world grinding and fighting DEs so you can get the desired number of Drop Points. This particularly works well in Proud mode. I hear that Standard mode is sort of easy. (For Proud, it's probably not easy to do this in the beginning of the game, but a little later on, I find that spending an hour or two in one world can net me, at least, 200 DPs easily.)\n\nAny remaining Drop Points get turned into munny, which can be used for more Drop-Me-Nots, so it's a fair deal.\n\nIf you ever come across people constantly complaining about Dropping constantly in the middle of boss battles or exploring in their games, there is something completely wrong with this picture. Some of these people do not know that Drop-Me-Nots exist so they keep playing through the game allowing the system to Drop for them. (Thus, thinking that the game \"forces\" them to rush.) You can also Drop yourself any time you want in the game via save points, accessing the menu, or putting the game on pause. So, you actually have full control of how you want to play the game rather than let the game play you. Couple that with the Drop-Me-Nots and highest Decelerator level, and you can play both characters for as long as you want. You just can't progress past a certain number of worlds as one character until you beat the other character's required portion of worlds. Their stories are suppose to play out in synch. Not separate like Birth by Sleep.\n\nI would recommend playing as one of character's world stories all out first before Dropping to another character's story and play that from beginning to end. That way, you wouldn't get that \"lost\" feeling of trying to remember what happened before you were there. (Though, you could consult the Momentos section just for a memory refresher.)\n\nOther people think they can only put the Drop-Me-Not in their active Command deck and it interrupts with their battles. For me, I put my Drop-Me-Not in the second Command deck, which is void of any Commands. It's very easy to go into the Command menu, switch to the second Command deck, press the X button for Drop-Me-Not, go back into the Command menu and switch back to my active Command deck. It only takes a few seconds to do this. You can make up to three Command decks, but I think one is enough for me and some other people to go by if you like mixing up your Commands once in awhile.\n\nNote of caution: Being hit by some Dream Eaters may cause your Drop Gauge to speed up a little so that adds a teeny bit of challenge to your time management. It's not really that much of an issue when you have Drop-Me-Nots at your disposal.\n\nThe Seven Sleeping Worlds -----\n\nYou go through seven huge worlds. Some of them, you've been to before, but they're expanded. You may think you knew one area so well, but turn a corner, and you may find yourself becoming lost in it (which is good in my book). In true KH fashion, you'll find most of them to be \"empty\" except with Moogles and unlimited Dream Eaters/Tron NPCs. So, it's not really a surprise if you're use to this from the past KH games. The only difference here is that you won't be bumping into any standing non-Moogle NPCs. As I said earlier in this impression/review, they're all accessed through cutscenes.\n\nFor this kind of game, I don't mind there being a lack of standing non-Moogle NPCs, because they'll be in the way of the Flowmotion. Furthermore, coming across them, they'll usually say the same things over and over when you talk to them. Thirdly, I don't see any way you could incorporate non-Moogle NPCs in this game as all the worlds are in dreamland dreaming up of only the \"important\" characters of their respective worlds. Thus, these worlds are not the true versions of themselves. And yet, I have a feeling we can never truly know what's real or not later on in the game.\n\nThe Portals -----\n\nThere are four types of portals that exist in DDD.\n\nOne is a \"Dive\" portal that is used to travel between worlds that replace the existence of Gummi ships/shape-shifting keyblades. You only have to do them once per character and world, but you can replay them over and over in order to obtain certain abilities. Like KH2, traveling through a Dive portal is in the form of a mini-game. You'll come across some special Dive bosses in the midst of your travels. I enjoy the challenge of not being able to obtain the required amount of points or dying in these Dive portals. It makes you want to push your limit with what you can do.\n\nThe other three portals are Dream Eater related. One of them is the \"Friendship\" portal that lets you leave three DEs anywhere in the seven worlds, that will be found by other players via local wi-fi. Your DEs will be borrowed by those other players in order to fight the enemy DEs. The other portal works just like the friendship portal, except, it requires you to fight against the DEs that other players left for you.\n\nIf you don't know anybody nearby with DDD (that's like, the majority of KH players in the West), worry not. There are preset random A.I. portals that show up everywhere in the game. They all have Final Fantasy related names so you can't miss them.\n\nThe fourth portal is strictly an A.I. set up challenge type of portal that's known as \"Special\". Each Special portal you find gives you a requirement you must fulfill in order to make a mark of accomplishment in your Journal.\n\nThe Extra Content & Post-game Stuff To Do? -----\n\nI previously explained that there are some mini-games you can do with Dream Eaters, while another one is the Dive portal system. The third one is the Flick Rush game, which is found in the first world (Traverse Town). It's a game that takes a little bit of patience and number skill to succeed through. Primarily, it works just like Chain of Memories' battle system, but at a faster pace and you must find a way to match up cards in order to get the upper hand. It's definitely a fun addicting mini-game. What you win from a Flick Rush round are a number of medals that can be traded in for abilities, items, etc. at the Moogle's medal shop. This is a refreshing change from seeing the Olympus Colosseum in almost every single KH game.\n\nIf you want the full experience of a game, you do your best on 100%ing the game. On top of collecting over 50 Dream Eaters, completing most of the DEs' matrix boards, and finding every single Comamnd/ability out there, there are 438 treasure chests to be found. For me, I try to find as many chests as I can while playing in the main story, rather then save it for post-game stuff. Some people do it that way, but I rather do it all before the final boss.\n\nThe amount of collectibles are smaller than how many collectibles you have to find in Birth by Sleep, but just like Birth by Sleep, there is a Trophy Shelf that needs to be fulfilled. Eighteen trophies to be exact. They are all mostly doable, except the questionable link portal trophy. So, these trophies add onto the re-playability. One of the trophies require you to beat the game in Critical mode.\n\nAs for what goes on post-game-wise, I know there is a New Game+, which is a little rare for a KH game. (Birth by Sleep touched \"lightly\" on this with Aqua.) I believe your Dream Eaters are carried over, but a lot of other things do not.\n\nMusic -----\n\nYoko Shimomura, Takeharu Ishimoto, and the rest of the DDD composers, arrangers and performers all deserve a big pat on their backs for creating another golden KH soundtrack. With everything from old songs we've heard before to new composed ones, there's nothing really much else I have to say with their music. It's magic. ^_^\n\nOverall ----- <3\n\nDDD is easily up there with Birth by Sleep for me in the favorite KH column. It's not a perfect game, but it's fun and won my heart easily. I wish you could be more interactive with your environments, beyond what they give you here in both BbS and DDD, and be able to unlock more hidden things/rooms/secrets. Also, I wish the portal system and Flick Rush game were open to global wi-fi instead of just local wi-fi. Those issues I have are minor compared to a lot of things that I do like in this game. (And if there's anything else I notice, I'll add it in here.)\n\nLooking forward to seeing how this game sets everyone up for KH3. :)", "summary": "This game can Drop-Me-Not forever and ever and ever....[update 1]", "unixReviewTime": 1345593600}

This news is especially good for those who like me have been long time followers of the series. I don't want to give away storyline specifics so I'll just give the general description of the story. Sora and Riku received a message at the end of Kingdom Hearts II which, as it turns out requested that they return to Yen Sid's tower because King Mickey and his friends are in desperate need of his help. There is an impending danger that our heroes will need to face and in order to do this they must gain a new power by taking the Mark Of Mastery exam. Which for our heroes is more like a trial by fire than an ordinary exam because in order to pass they must awaken seven sleeping worlds.\n\n  Now I'll move on to gameplay. Starting in Traverse Town we are introduced to a game mechanic known as flow motion. Flow motion makes the environment around you more interactive which can especially come in handy during battles. How it does this is for example you can slide down rails and bounce off walls ti create a more powerful finishing move. (For those of you who might be interested it is in Traverse  Town that Neku and the gang from The World Ends With You make their epic cameo). Another important gameplay mechanic is the use of Spirits, In terms of how the game is played your personal dream eater spirits take the place of Donald and Goofy who worked as Sora's sidekicks in previous titles. it is important to a)Make sure they don't die. b)Make sure you bond and interact with them. c) Make sure you dream link with them which depending on which character your currently playing with results in either Sora teaming up for powerful attacks or Riku's own attacks becoming more powerful. Finally, d)make sure you level up the ability links which gives both the Spirits and your characters new abilities. The third new game mechanic which at times can be the most frustrating is the addition of the \"drop gauge.\" This mechanism leads to the forced switching between the Characters Of Riku and Sora. Although. at times dropping can be rather seamless between the characters I learned the hard way that you must keep your eye on the gauge before starting a boss fight or even a mini boss fight. I can't tell you how many times I was dropped when only one or two hits away from defeating a boss only to have to start over when dropped back to the character. The last gameplay mechanic I want to discuss is reality Shift. Reality Shift much like flow motion allows for further interaction with each world's environment. From the simplistic barrel throwing of Traverse Town to the interactive comic reality shift of The Three Musketeers world,\n\n  Overall, I really love this game and in my opinion it puts Kingdom Hearts back on the map. I love the fact that even though it all connects to the game's storyline overall we get two perspectives and two different portions of the story of each world via Sora and Riku's respective visits. My favorite world was La cite Des Cloches where we meet the cast of The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, In terms of the storyline it was a segment in which I enjoyed both perspectives. Aesthetically I most loved Symphony of Sound A.K.A. Fantasia world. It was so bright and colorful. The reality shift I enjoyed most is in The Three Musketeers world where you can beat some enemies through an interactive comic strip. My least favorite world is as in previous KH games Monstro I always get so lost in there!\nI recommend the game to any KH fan, After the abomination that was Re Coded we all so deserved this.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts revived", "unixReviewTime": 1345248000}
{"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2012", "reviewerID": "A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN", "asin": "B006OI3CTS", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "MisterMusicFan", "reviewText": "A world filled with Disney and Final Fantasy-themed characters was certainly never something anyone asked for, but it's added up to quite the fascinating franchise in the form of Kingdom Hearts, which has always sported a distinct mixture of doe-eyed innocence and encroaching darkness. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance marks the series' seventh installment overall, and the fifth on a handheld console. While a vast majority of the Kingdom Hearts games have been spinoffs of the primary two (with KH3 being so long delayed), oftentimes featuring storylines of side characters that generally add up to prequels or epilogues, Dream Drop Distance returns to the core storylines of main characters Sora and Riku, although it's never made entirely clear where this particular timeline falls (it is rumored, however, that this game's ending ties directly into KH3, which series director Tetsuya Nomura has supposedly insisted will be the next release). The Kingdom Hearts storyline as a whole is rather convoluted and a bit melodramatic, but very moving and thought-provoking nonetheless. For those initially unfamiliar with the finer details (like myself-this is admittedly the first KH title I've personally played), all you need to know for now is this: best friends Sora and Riku are prompted by the powerful wizard Master Yen Sid (the elderly wizard from Disney's Fantasia) to take the Mark of Mastery Exam in preparation for an approaching threat to multiple worlds. Although they both have already been awarded keyblades, powerful weapons used to correct the balance between light and darkness in the world as needed, they must complete this test before they may be deemed true Keyblade Masters and gain access to the power they'll need for the evil that approaches. This test requires them to enter a series of worlds which were in one timeline destroyed by the Heartless (physical manifestations of darkness, beings devoid of emotion, oftentimes in the guises of Disney and Final Fantasy-themed villains throughout the series) and then restored, but somewhere in between fell into a deep sleep that rendered them incapable of connecting with one another. In an effort to properly \"awaken\" and interconnect the worlds to restore balance once again, Sora and Riku must unlock the seven Sleeping Keyholes, each of which lies somewhere within a sleeping world.\n\nEarly on in this test, the bright-eyed Sora and brooding Riku are separated from one another, hurled into separate versions of the same worlds. This adds up to separate but interconnecting timelines in which different events occur in the same locations/periods, which also ties directly into the gameplay: in KH3D, you'll spend half the time playing as Sora and half the time playing as Riku, each of whom maintains his own separate progression in each world. This is a unique feature that also incorporates the new \"Drop\" system, which sets off a timer each time you begin adventuring with one of the two heroes. This `timer' comes in the form of the Drop Gauge, which slowly depletes but can reduce or increase quicker depending on what types of items or techniques you use. Once the Drop Gauge hits zero and your time's up, your current character will \"Drop,\" at which point he'll immediately stop whatever it is he's doing and retreat into a sleeping state; then the storyline will switch and you can begin playing as the other character with his own renewed Drop Gauge. This might sound wonky at first but it actually adds an exciting sense of urgency and time progression, encouraging you not to neglect one storyline in favor of the other (they both thankfully tend to remain pretty engaging). You can use items such as Drop-Me-Nots to extend the duration of your Drops, and you can also Drop at will as needed, but keep in mind what you do in one storyline can sometimes affect the other: throughout battles you'll collect Drop Points, which can be used at the end of each Drop to give various boosts to the character you're switching over to, such as increases in attack power, defense, Drop duration and more. You sometimes won't be able to advance to the next section of the world map until you complete a world with both Sora and Riku, so there are many tactical decisions to consider throughout each Drop. My only gripe about this feature is the fact that if you Drop during a boss battle, you'll have to start it over when you Drop back, which can expectedly be really obnoxious, especially for lengthy ones. Because of this I'd recommend keeping watch of your Drop Gauge especially before specific encounters and equipping Drop-Me-Nots as needed.\n\nThe combat in KH3D is very fast-paced and exciting, and definitely among the game's brightest highlights. Somewhat like a mish-mash of popular MMOs, Kid Icarus: Uprising and various Legend of Zelda titles, you'll rely on different types of melee weapons (i.e. keyblades) and magic spells to attack enemies from either afar or in the fray. KH3D marks the return of the battle deck, a handy system that allows you to set a customizable series of attacks and abilities for use on the battlefield. You can create separate decks (such as one focused mainly on fire-based attacks, one mainly on healing HP, a balanced mix of everything, etc.) and whip them out from the Pause menu as needed. The deck automatically switches through your magic in the order you select from the deck creation menu as you use each ability; you can also use the D-pad to manually backtrack or swap around mid-combat to particular ones, but each move has a cooldown period you'll have to wait through before a successive use. Expectedly, very powerful/useful abilities have longer cooldowns, so you'll have to consider this when building your decks. There are a vast variety of magic abilities, with spells that can set foes aflame, freeze them, trap them in midair gravity vortexes, home in on them from afar, cure your HP or relieve you of status conditions and much more. Veterans of the series will fondly remember the igniting Firaga, electrifying Thundara and ever-useful Curaga. As you progress through the game you'll earn different and increasingly powerful magic spells for your deck in addition to new keyblades for slashing melee strikes. The X button is used to call forth magic spells from your deck while the A button initiates physical attacks and keyblade combos. With several dozen types of enemies and bosses with varying resistances and weaknesses (as you might expect, water-based foes tend to feel the hurt against electricity and icy enemies don't fancy fire), there's a lot to consider (and enjoy).\n\nAn importantly integrated new feature is that of the Dream Eaters, colorful, cuddly critters found commonly as both friends and foes throughout the game. Friendly Dream Eaters are known as Spirits, and they will be absolutely essential to your arsenal in combat. You can create Spirits from Dream Pieces you gather as you battle, and there are a great deal of recipes that make for all types of useful creatures, whether it be an HP-recovering flower or ferocious T-Rex. This adds a very Pokmon-esque element to the game as you level up your Spirits to become stronger and gain new powerful abilities as they fight alongside you in each and every battle. You'll use a Final Fantasy-inspired Ability Link table to progressively unlock new abilities, which will also have direct effects on Sora and Riku. Spirit abilities can in fact come in the form of stat boosts, so using certain Spirits who've gained certain abilities can allow increased resistances to certain attack types or even immunities to certain status conditions. In other words, these little guys can offer both an offensive and defensive edge. They can also unlock brand new magic spells for Sora and Riku to use, in addition to their own attacks to initiate mid-battle. In order to increase a Spirit's Link Points (used to progress through their Ability Link table and gain new abilities), you'll have to play with and feed them, very similar to a Nintendog or a Tamagotchi. You do so by petting them on the touchscreen with your stylus from the pause menu, which is also where you can toss them cakes, cookies and other treats to increase their stats. While it's adorable at first, it becomes tedious as the game progresses, and the fact that it's the only way to push Spirits to their maximum potential becomes pretty obnoxious. Thankfully the Spirits are at least very nice to look at, with quite literally every one sporting colorful, detailed and ultra-cute designs (you'll be very motivated to catch `em all). Be warned, by the way: prevent your Spirit from dying in battle at all costs, because if it does, it reverts back into Dream Pieces. You can recreate it, but it will lose all of its learned abilities and start back at its initial level. Luckily you'll be warned when they're in danger, and you'll have the opportunity to go save them (this also won't be a problem nearly as often as you might think unless you take low level Spirits into intense fights).\n\nOne of the greatest features of Spirits is the ability you'll have to \"Link\" with them; as they fight with you and gain affinity for you (which happens as you battle with them often, play with and feed them), their Link Gauge, which is displayed on the touchscreen, increases. Once it's hit its maximum, you can tap the Spirit's icon to Link with it, which can cause one of two in-battle events depending on who you're playing as. Sora becomes able to initiate a series of super-attacks (or one single powerful one) with the Spirit itself for a certain period, while Riku physically merges with the Spirit and gains one of its abilities himself. If both Link Gauges are full, you can even Link with both of your Spirits at once for an even more devastating Link attack. The Link abilities range from showering the battlefield in damaging light while fully healing your entire party to swishing around with bat wings and initiating lethal dark magic-infused combos. The individual and combo Links vary depending on your Spirits, and it's great fun to experiment with them and their bedazzling visuals.\n\nAnother new feature exclusive to KH3D is Flowmotion, a unique ability that allows Sora and Riku to air dash and launch themselves off walls to climb up them, attack enemies, or move very quickly throughout the area. You can also use Flowmotion to swing around poles or slide along grind rails. This is a very welcome addition and should in all honesty become a series staple, as it allows for fantastic maneuverability and thrilling battle sequences. Although it can feel unwieldy at first, once you've practiced a bit you just might start to wonder how you progressed through any game ever without it. Reality Shifts, meanwhile, allow Sora and Riku to enter portals that allow them to bend the rules of time and space; activate one and gameplay will shift to the touchscreen, initiating one of several mini-games (they differ by world) tying into the current theme; cracking codes in Tron: Legacy's Grid will allow you to manipulate surrounding technology, while you can create unhappy comic endings for cartoony baddies in the Country of the Musketeers. Features like this offer some very exciting gameplay changeups throughout.\n\nAs KH fans have surely come to expect, you'll progress through a series of Disney-themed worlds featuring familiar scenery, characters and self-contained story arcs (the best of which tie into the central plot). Tron: Legacy and Pinocchio all make for beautiful backdrops, but I was never personally the biggest fan of Hunchback of Notre Dame (although it does make for some well-designed stage terrain and shockingly dark storyline action), and The Three Musketeers was flat out a poor choice (it is overall the dullest, most inane world here). The Fantasia world in particular, however, features an array of intoxicating visual splendor, and the fact that most sound effects are shut off in favor of the warmly familiar musical scores makes for a truly immersive thematic experience. The thrilling, heart-racing, generally epic boss battles at the end of each world are among the game's most memorable highlights, featuring once again a mix of Disney/Square Enix-themed baddies. You'll see some awesome familiar faces in addition to some startling new ones.\n\nAlong the lines of flaws, there certainly are a few but thankfully nothing prevents the game from being generally great. For one, the game unfortunately sports a particularly wonky and uncooperative camera that ordinarily has to be manually moved to the direction most people would prefer (a problem I've heard has actually been plaguing most of the series). You can lock on to specific enemies to make focal points easier to keep track of, but occasionally your lock will seemingly cancel at random, which can prove very frustrating in intense boss battles. Additionally, while most of this RPG's platforming is pretty smooth, oddball ticks in stage environments can make for off-kilter interaction, as you may be unable to jump on or Flowmotion across certain things you'd strongly expect to be able to. There are also odd and vaguely sporadic instances of lag after using certain attacks and particularly after blocking attacks; Sora and Riku will sometimes behave as though they are briefly stunned from shielding, particularly after using several successive attacks or when there's a lot going on. Whether this was intentional or not, at its worst your movement will feel clunky in spurts (which can be a total buzzkill in the frantic pace of certain boss fights). Keep in mind, however, that KH3D's strengths so far outshine its weaknesses that very, very few players are likely to walk away sincerely saying they were wholeheartedly dissatisfied with the overall experience.\n\nKH3D as a whole is overall glorious to behold, with beautifully rendered cutscenes featuring spot-on voice acting (much of the star-studded original cast returns) and a generally gorgeous visual style ensuring you're never bored with what you see onscreen. This game really shows what the 3DS is capable of, and what will hopefully be further utilized in the future. Although its storyline strays a bit far from the core plot at times and will definitely confuse newbies, everything comes together during its particularly epic conclusion, as things fluidly segue into what all KH fans have been eagerly waiting for. Whether you're a dedicated longtime fan or a 3DS owner looking for some fast-paced, aesthetically pleasing action, Kingdom Hearts 3D is an absolute must-have.", "summary": "You won't want this dream to end", "unixReviewTime": 1344902400}

Games like Re:Coded, which don't really add as much to the series as one expects. But then you have a game like Birth By Sleep that's a fantastic game. Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance (or 3D, if you must) is more in touch with Birth By Sleep. And, in fact, those who played Birth By Sleep will get so much more out of it. Dream Drop Distance is by far one of the better Kingdom Hearts spinoffs out there, and one that Kingdom Hearts fans with a 3DS should play.\n\nThe story centers on Sora, Riku and Mickey as they take the trials to become keyblade masters. They must go through a series of challenges to prove themselves. Unfortunately things get a little messed up in the process and it involves a much bigger adventure at play. The story can seem just a tad bit confusing, but this is because it relies on you having knowledge of prior games. It'll try its best to catch you up to speed but in the long run, it's best to actually play prior games (in particular: Birth By Sleep). You're going to meet a few new characters (Neku from The World Ends with You shows up here) and a few old. You'll also travel to various Disney worlds just as you've done before.  This is not a game for first time players of Kingdom Hearts.  The story is not as simple as it seems and Dream Drop Distance is going to be confusing to anyone who decides to start their Kingdom Hearts romp here.\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D plays a lot like it's older brothers on the PS2, DS and PSP, but here things are more refined. A lot of the Kingdom Hearts spinoffs have done quite a few things to mess with the system at play. While the gameplay remains familiar in Dream Drop Distance, there area few things added. You'll begin by playing a combat tutorial that will definitely give you a run down. The games basic structure hasn't changed. It's still an action RPG through and through where you can lock on to targets and attack them. While also manipulating through various spells and techniques. After using each spell or technique it's going to recharge before you do it again. This keeps one from spamming everything and keeps Dream Drop Distance from being too touch. Likewise, you'll gain more ability slots and be able to set more as you go.\n\nThere are a few additions to combat, though, such as the reality shift. When locked onto enemies the cursor will become pink and you can engage in a Reality Shift attack. These attacks change based on your location. In Traverse Town, for instance, it's a slingshot that will allow you to fling objects (or enemies) at other foes. You can also do flow motion attacks where you use the objects and environments around you to go ahead and pull off other attacks.\n\nThe biggest addition is how the team mechanics are done. There's no Donald and Goofy to team up with this time around. Instead you'll have to contend with Dream Eaters. These Dream Eaters are the ones invading the worlds you must save. But there are also friendly Dream Eaters called spirits that you can create using materials you gain from fallen foes (called Nightmares). They're more or less your pets and they'll help out in battle. If you spend time with them and care for them you can build up their stats.\n\nYou'll play as both Sora and Riku throughout the experience. But Dream Drop Distance utilizes a \"drop\" system. Both character's have a drop gauge and when it depletes entirely that character will \"drop\" and you'll pick up as the other character. This can even happen in the middle of combat or when you're simply running around. The system in and of itself can feel very strange at first (especially when you drop in the middle of a fight) and it's likely to rub some people the wrong way. The good news is that you can also drop manually if you feel like it. And if you're wise about how you do it you won't drop in the middle of a tough fight. That being said, when you resume it's not s though you'll find yourself right in the thick of a boss fight. The battle will reset.\n\nThe game is telling two parallel stories so when you \"drop\" and the other character takes over it's not from where one left off. Sora and Riku will both be doing their own thing in the same area and starting off from their own point. The drops will not be a surprise as you'll always know when they're coming and you'll be able to prepare accordingly.\n\nKingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance is a great game, but definitely not perfect. The only thing that may seem a bit odd is that there's a lot to learn about the combat of the game. Things get off to a slow and awkward start as the game constantly bombard's you with tutorials, explanations and flashbacks. It doesn't settle into a good groove for quite some time. Kingdom Hearts games usually have lengthy prologues or tutorials, but they're usually integrated in a way that doesn't break up the flow of the game itself. Dream Drop Distance is constantly stopping combat and story to do so. And while it is most certainly important to learn the game the rate at which these tutorials come is more than likely going to make the player feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe second thing that's hard to overcome is that the mechanic of \"dropping\" just seems gimmicky in and of itself. The story and game itself offer up little reason for it to be implemented. The game could've easily told two parallel stories in a fashion similar to how Birth By Sleep did it's simultaneous story lines. Instead we have a drop mechanic. It's a good thing they let you also drop manually. The point is, the mechanic in and of itself still feels very gimmicky and of all the things that Dream Drop Distance does this may be the one that you'll care for the least.\n\nThe 3DS has a wide range of good looking games. Kingdom Hearts 3D is by far one of the better looking on the system. While games like Resident Evil Revelations do a great job at what they do, Kingdom Hearts is colorful and vibrant. Sometimes even looking better and smoother than the PS2 older brothers. The environments are incredibly detailed and populated. The frame rate never dips or slows down and it's just easy on the eyes. The 3D isn't bad either, but like most 3DS games, isn't really integral to the visual experience of the game itself. The music is very good, though most tunes are familiar. They're either remixed from older Kingdom Hearts titles or ripped directly from them. From a production standpoint a 3DS game has rarely looked this good.\n\nIn the end, for Kingdom Hearts fans, Dream Drop Distance is a great game that really adds to the story and mythos at hand. It's worth playing.", "summary": "A Pleasant Dream", "unixReviewTime": 1344211200}

In all of these games, the gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged, with the exception of \"Re:Coded\", which was otherwise a disappointment in my book. It seemed that, on the surface, Square Enix was simply jumping on the 3DS bandwagon and shelling out another half-baked entry in order to stall before people tore down their door and demanded Kingdom Hearts III already. Regardless, I decided to give this the benefit of the doubt, and I'm pleased to announce that this is the best game in the series since \"KHII\". In fact, it may arguably be the best entry yet.\n\nWe join Sora and Riku after the events of II and \"Re:Coded\". Riku is playing for the good guys again, teaming up with Sora to take on the Mark of Mastery exam. This involves them travelling to various worlds in order to find hidden keyholes that will prove their meddle as true Keyblade Masters. The plot is a welcome change of pace from the treacly sentimentality of \"358/2 Days\", the rehashed narrative in \"Birth By Sleep\", and the confused logic and pacing of \"Re:Coded.\" Nomura and all others involve certainly listened to the critics when it came to the story in this entry, and gave us what we wanted: a true follow-up. Much in the vein of \"Chain of Memories\", \"Dream Drop Distance\" expands on world of the game without losing its focus, and never gets lost trying to pander to fans. The result is the most focused game yet, and one whose story is filled with enough emotion and excitement for any gamer to enjoy. That being said, it's best to be familiar with the franchise before tackling this one. Newcomers may feel a little bit lost.\n\nMy main concern about \"DDD\" was definitely the gameplay, given that it hasn't really changed in several years. All fears have been put to rest now, due to the fact that the dev team definitely took their time with making a fun and balanced experience. The level-based hack-n-slash we're used to is still here, but it's aided by the addition of a new system called \"Flowmotion.\" This is a snazzy way of saying that Sora and Riku now fancy themselves to be masters of parkour. The real surprise here is that Square Enix managed to slide in a new gameplay feature without turning it into a convoluted wreck. Flowmotion works fabulously. Within a few minutes of playing, you'll be grinding off of rails, using enemies as pommel horses, and careening off walls hundreds of feet in the air. Doing this allows you to deliver devastating special moves on enemies. Every enemy encounter, and especially every boss stage, transcends typical button-mashing battles and turns into something more visceral and downright fun than I ever expected from this franchise.\n\nThe other addition is the \"Drop\" feature. You'll be playing as both Sora and Riku in this game, as they battle through parallel worlds to find the hidden keyholes. This works in a very unique way; you have a time with each character, as they experience different narratives in the same worlds. You have to beat the world with both characters in order to truly beat it and progress the story. This is less cumbersome than it sounds, and is in fact a very interesting way to approach handling both characters. You can also jump to another character early by using the \"Drop\" button on the pause menu. This can be handy if you get to a good stopping point in one character's progression. Getting to experience both characters' unique perspectives is a welcome change in pace for the series.\n\nAnother worth mentioning, if only for a few sentences, is the addition of Spirit companions. Much like the world-specific partners of previous games, these animals fight side-by-side with you and can be teamed up with for a special attack. However, it works in a similar fashion to the \"Shin Megami Tensei\", where you collect certain components of the monsters, then combine them in order to create them. Depending on how many components you have, you can alter the strength and abilities of the monsters. You can have three with you at any given time, and I highly recommend you do so. These partners are very helpful, and fun to customize and level up. The interface for leveling them is very similar to a virtual pet simulator by way of \"Final Fantasy X\"'s level system. It's not too complicated, but not overly simplistic. Just the right balance of strategy and fun make this a worthwhile component to an already great game.\n\nGraphically, this is the best-looking game in the series, without a doubt. Having played several 3DS titles, I can firmly say this is the prettiest one yet, and clearly demonstrative of what we can expect from Square Enix in the near future. Environments pop to life with dazzling use of textures and shadows, and everything blazes forward with no drop in the frame rate. From Notre Dame to The Grid, these are beautiful renderings of iconic settings, some of which have never been visited in the franchise before. The only negative is, unfortunately, the uneven use of 3D. Frame rate has a noticeable drop when the feature is used in some areas, yet flows smoothly in others. While the effects are nice and all, I would recommend only using it for cutscenes. The game actually stands very strong on its own graphical merits, and the effects steal the thunder a little bit.\n\nHaley Joel Osment (remember him?) turns in another show-stealing performance as Sora, enough to make one wonder why he hasn't just decided to become a full-time voice actor already. The rest of the cast is predictably great, as is the music. The soundtrack once again spans a variety of styles, implementing the techno and trip-hop found in \"The World Ends With You\" when its characters are on-screen. There's nothing more to say, really, given that people already know Square Enix excels in this department.\n\nHere we are, seven years after \"Kingdom Hearts II\" left us speechless, and we're finally given the sequel we've wanted for so long. According to series creator Nomura, \"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance\" is a taste of the gameplay we can expect from the third entry. If this is truly the case, then I say bring it on. This is the best entry in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series so far, and a surefire candidate for Handheld Game of the Year. If you've been holding out because of Square Enix's incessant milking of the franchise, this is the one you've been waiting for.\n\nIronic. In creating the best game of this stellar series, the developers have created perhaps the best 3DS title yet.\n\nStory: 9\nGameplay: 10\nGraphics: 9\nSound: 10\nOverall: 9.5", "summary": "Square Enix's Redemption", "unixReviewTime": 1343865600}

Kennedy", "reviewText": "I have been a Kingdom Hearts fan since I bought the first game the day it came out. While I started to loose faith in the handheld titles, Birth by Sleep recaptured the imagination and amazing storytelling that sucked me into the series. The same team was put in charge of this title, and I truly hope they are in charge of the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 3 we have already waited 6 years for. I don't want to spoil anything, but as with all Kingdom Hearts titles you can guess the entire story from the intro video. Luckily this time it included the main plot points from every previous title in the series.\n\nThis game:\nThe graphics are amazing, even better than the PS2 sequences. The 3d adds even more depth to an already amazing game. I have 10 3ds games including LoZ:OoT, Starfox, and Mario 3d Land. Kingdom Hearts 3D definitely is the best 3d game I have seen to date.\nFlow motion is a bit hard to get used to at first, but by the end of the first level it will be your main source of damage to enemies. If you were annoyed as I was at times at how long it took to get across the vast Kingdom Hearts maps, you will love this feature.\nThe Dream Eaters are cool in concept, and definitely make controlling Riku more awesome (try giving him wings). However, the developers attempted to make them Nintendogs meet Tomogatchi. Which means to make them truly useful in combat you need to show them affection and play minigames to fully power them up. Luckily to beat the game you don't technically have to participate in this side activity, but all of your stat boosts are dependent on doing this.\nSpoiler for those who know nothing of the game/% There are seven worlds, each needs to have its keyhole locked to have Sora and Riku finish their Mark of Mastery Exam. Each world is split into two parts such that Sora and Riku can play the same world from different storylines and perspectives. %\\ Each of the worlds in the game are \"new.\" Even Traverse Town has a new and expanded twist with the addition of The World Ends With You characters and Shibuya style.\nDropping is my least favorite part of the game, but it does help propel the story. It takes a few drops to really get used to (especially if you are like me and attempt to grab every treasure chest on the first play through), but it forces you to keep up with the stories of both Sora and Riku. As much as dropping annoys me, I remember KH Chain of Memories where you had to play as Riku after Sora by which point you probably forgot part of the story. Or Birth by Sleep where you had to play the game from 3 different perspectives. The nice thing is that if you fall behind with a character, you can \"drop\" early and switch back to the other character.\n\nOverall Kingdom Hearts 3D takes a little while to get used to, but once you get past the first hour or so of gameplay you will find so much to love. The character development, graphics, and battle system make this the most unique and arguably best handheld Kingdom Hearts to date. I have high hopes for what Square Enix will do with the third installment of this amazing series.\n\nFirst time Kingdom Hearts Players: While I think the team did a great job of making the intro video tell the main story of the game, there is a lot of story to catch up on. I would suggest either finding a website with a description of the main parts of each game (most of the storyline will be \"spoiled\" by playing this game anyway), or make sure to read every report in your journal as you collect it. If you don't care about storyline, then this is a perfect starting point in the series. The battle system and worlds are a lot of fun, even if you don't know exactly what is going on in the grand scheme of things.", "summary": "Best Handheld Kingdom Hearts to Date", "unixReviewTime": 1343779200}

With a much more interesting story, better battle mechanics, and characters with more life than cardboard cutouts, it is an improvement in every way. As always my reviews are split into 3 categories: Story, Gameplay, and Characters with the Story getting the most weight.\n\nStory 8/10\n\nThe story in the second witcher game is very well written. You pick up right after the end of the first game protecting King Foltest. Soon after you are on the run from the law and are trying to clear your name. The story does a good job of building up over time until the ending which is fabulous. Overall the story suffers the same issue with timing as the original witcher. In both games, the story struggles to get going in the first chapter. Also, in many parts, the story is just difficult to follow. The game is another example of the writers assuming the player knows a lot about the lore of the witcher universe, or the multitudes of factions, and leaves details out which makes it difficult to piece together. Nonetheless, the story is engaging once you get it going about half way through the first chapter. And overall the ending is extremely satisfying.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nThis is where the 2nd installment really shines. The gameplay was easily the weakest part of the first game but here you can tell the developers spent quite a bit of time fixing those issues. Gone are the time based rhythm attacks that were infuriating over the course of the first game. In the witcher 2, they have implemented a much more tactical battle mechanic which is a welcome addition.  Also implementing counter moves and blocking. BLOCKING. YES! They have also implemented a new battle menu system that makes it much easier to quickly switch Signs and putting things in your quick slots such as bombs and traps. The overall layout for leveling and maps are also much improved. They have also implemented things like armor and weapon upgrades that you can add certain attributes to your armor and weapons to give them added bonuses on the fly. Unfortunately, the game has several bugs in it that make some portion of the games nearly unplayable. One in particular was an optional boss fight that required you to extinguish torches so he could no longer summon monsters. Well the player can't select the torches to extinguish and instead just runs through them. Another glitch where a player has to let a certain NPC walk through a door first or the game crashes. Getting stuck in walls is a common problem. Other than the glitches,  the gamplay was much improved.\n\nCharacters: 8/10\nSo Geralt is still Geralt. Yet the voice actor seems to have improved since the first. He seems to have a bit of emotion now. Geralt is almost fully customizable when it comes to personality. Certain characters returning from the original are also well done like Triss, Dandelion, and Zoltan. New characters like Letho, and Roache really knock it out of the park as well. Some of the new ones though really don't do a lot or show me a lot. Sila for instance is just kind of....there. And it's unfortunate that if you side with Roache you almost don't experience Saskia at all as she seems to be one of the better characters in the game. Nonetheless, the characters are an improvement and overall do not detract from the game.\n\nOverall 8/10\n\nThe Witcher 2 is a really fun game once you get going. They have improved the gameplay quite impressively and many of the characters are really a charm. If you can get through the first 5-8 hours of the game, the rest of it really is a treat.", "summary": "A marked improvement over the original", "unixReviewTime": 1445817600}

Now, the Witcher 3 came out and I need a new video card to play it, so I picked up 2 while I save for a video card.\n\nAnyway, the game itself is great.  Much like the first game, the storyline and lore is truly amazing, as is the soundtrack.  They have streamlined the quests much more so there is a lot less traveling and repetition in gameplay, which is for the better in most cases.  They have improved the combat system greatly from the first one as well (one of its weak points) which goes from a rhythmic clicking from the first one, to blocking, parrying and dodging attacks which makes combat a whole lot more fun.  After playing through the game twice, I was still walking around looking for fights in this game!\n\nMid-game, you have to pick which side you want to fight for, which completely changes Chapters 2 & 3 in the game.  This essentially gives you an extra 166% of the content if you go back and play it as the other side again.  Additionally, they supported the game for a long time after release, just like the first game.\n\nThe only real negatives in this game is while they have streamlined the quests and removed much of the excessive and repetitive traveling, the game is also much shorter than the first one, and many little things that may be quite difficult in the first game, such as hunting down ingredients for a specific potion is nowhere near as difficult anymore either.

You should also read the read-me file just for information about a great deal of things that pertain to the game. As a relative new-comer to this series that I am (before-hand:  I had played the first installment Witcher-1 on a PC of which I hated because it was a low end machine; I had taken my CRPG \"hunt\" to Skyrim in 2011 (via Oblivion 2008 and Morrowind 2002 of which I won't get into here and but played religiously until 2013 when my ps3 was stolen after Halloween of which the crime has not been solved)  yet:  a house-fire, renovation, displacement without a gaming machine, had devastated me until I got a laptop and downloaded some old DOS games via a certain site, and then another certain site had taken me to Witcher-2: Assassins Of Kings Enhanced, this version I am reviewing here.  I had also bought a PS4 in the fall of 2014 for the sole intention of playing Witcher 3 on it.  I played Dragon Age Inquisition and The Last Of Us on the PS4, both beautiful games but didn't quite scratch that Skyrim itch), I went to the Good Old Games and found Arx Fatalis, which lead me to this game of which I had ignored because I was lost in Skyrim at time when it was released.  So! Here I am wondering what to do before the Witcher 3 release, and what luck! I found it's predecessor!  Things are going my way!  I can now prepare for the game of the decade, Witcher 3 (or maybe the century) by playing a microcosm of it:  Witcher 3. The developers of Witcher 3 proclaim that it is 35 times larger than Witcher 2 and two times larger than Skyrim!  There are so many reasons I am waiting to get my hands on The Witcher 3, and those reasons were confirmed when I started playing Witcher 2.\n\nAnyway, so far there is a big learning curve, but I love it!  Finally a CRPG that wasn't made for children, this is truly an adult's game.  No, it's not flagrantly adult for adult's sake, but it does deal with the reality of war, politics, love and whichever of the 7 deadly sins you wish to partake.  The medieval world this game presents is harsh, much like the real one 1000 years ago in Europe.  With all of the lore that our real Medieval Age created (dragons, magic, knights, highway robbery, witches, bestiary, etc), lore that we still dream about (don't tell me you haven't seen the Hobbit trilogy or the Lord of The Rings trilogy), this game does not come across as a child's movie.  We are entering a golden age of Computer Role Playing Games (CRPGs) with the advent of Witcher 3:  The Wild Hunt.  Skyrim gave us a glimpse of how things could be with an RPG on a computer platform or console when developers actually decide to do some real work instead of flowcharting everything into a nice neat little computer program that plays out more like a movie with the same ending.  Yes, all movies (except for maybe CLUE) have a single ending but to create a game that changes based on player-character choices, with 38 different endings, is a feat indeed my friends, quite a feat indeed.  This is next-gen programming and it opens a window to a whole new dimension of gaming.  This allows for real artificial intelligence, of which I believe will evolve through the high-end CRPG gaming industry because if NASA is developing it, you're not going to ever get to see it or even know about it.  HAL might exist now, but you're not hearing about it because there is the deep-seeded fear of true AI, it will never become pervasive if the government has anything to say about it.  However our society is in need of AI:  look at all of the controversy involved in bad calls in sports, video-recognition software exists but we continue to allow flawed humans to make these calls that affect millions of units of money (dollars, euros); don't you think doctors could use a second opinion too?  The vast databases of medical knowledge are not being used properly, we still rely on doctor's memories and research skills to find solutions.  AI could save lives, yet we look at it with the jaundiced eye of say, the Terminator series, or what HAL did in 2001 A Space Odyssey, or I Robot; the potential evil of AI has been laid out for all to see, that if we gave AI control, it would render humans useless and destroy us.  I think it's preposterous, we will need to develop AI for so many things in the future, a future that is becoming more and more complicated, we are going to need help.  Many things like space travel (who you gonna call when you're 3 light years away from earth and you need an answer within minutes or seconds, not the 3 years it would take to get the information to you?), medicine, navigation of flying cars (they're coming soon, but maybe not in our lifetime, but soon), virtual reality will require some tremendous AI (just ask Captain Picard about his misadventures in the Enterprise's holodeck), etc.  I quit ranting about AI but this should tell you about how excited I am about this game, and what promise for the future it portends.", "summary": "My CRPG game search for a time-filler before Witcher 3 release, brought me to Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition", "unixReviewTime": 1428537600}

You have to change the controls to the gamepad as it's set up for KB/Mouse as a default but this was not a problem. After getting that set up, I played thru the tutorial and the only place where I really had trouble was when you have to go deep into the menus to select an item. Must of this depends on selecting the RT button and then moving the L stick to select what you want. This proved to be a bit hard at times as the selections of items to get are controlled by the Left stick and it can take a bit to get it to stay on an item.  These things could really give you a problem in combat and you want to use a potion, etc. I got somewhat adjusted to get after a bit. Graphic are great, even on my system, and they seem smooth with not stuttering. Sound was good too. I like the way the story was told and how you can easily move around.

I said watch because that's what so much of it is. I had dearly hoped that by the end of the prologue (several hours long, heavy as heck with cut scenes) the game would open up, birth me into a world, and let me run amok. No. Instead, a small town.

I was four years late and I could not believe I missed such a good game. Granted, the graphics were not the best (although still good in 2011) and there were a few bugs but overall the story was very interesting and I was impressed by the tough choices to make in the story.\nThe games are based on a serie of books from the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski about the adventures of a Witcher (a hunter of monsters).\nFast forward to the game: \"The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings\" which I just finished playing about two days ago.\nWhen it came out first, it was with a mix reviews. Some enhancements were made and this is indeed the version I will review. Here is my opinion:\n\n- Graphics: Excellent\n- Difficulty: very variable. Easy is too easy, Normal can be very hard. I did not try harder levels.\n- Story: Excellent.\n- Game play duration: About 40-50 hours depending on how much you like to roam around.\n- The interface could be improved much.\n\nNow let me expand a bit and without spoilers.\n\nThe graphics are amongst the greatest I have seen. On par with Far Cry 3 in my opinion. I really loved the story and it really shows that the 3rd installment is coming although it did not always offer me the type of choices or comments I would have liked to make.\n\nThe combats were secondary in this game, meaning that there is not that much thinking to do to win a fight. Either you are the strongest or you will get a beating. In the first game, you could drink some specific potions to improve your abilities during the combat. Now you cannot anymore since you have to meditate before drinking them and you can't during a fight. There are also a lot of nice cut-scenes but very often, the potions that you drunk before will be gone by the time the fight start... Is that a bug? I don't know but it was a bummer since they would have been frankly welcome during some fights. What is the point to go to so much lengths to gather herbs and prepare potions if you could mostly do without.\nI also disliked the fact that the game would sometimes progress with no regard to your fighting capabilities. Let me explain: there are fights you are visibly not supposed to win, regardless of your performances. So you are beating your opponents and a cut scene takes over and shows you getting beaten. Really?...\nOn the other hand, the fights are pretty to look at and the animations are great.\nCompared to the Witcher 1, the combat feels dumbed down but prettier.\nIf you want to play the Witcher for the combat, you  may end up with a weird aftertaste. For me it was either too easy or too hard. In one important fight, I was getting a serious beating every time on normal level and I decided to switch it to easy to see and I then managed to beat my opponent without any effort... I think it is too unbalanced.\n\nWhere I was not disappointed was in the story itself. One can see it was made by a professional writer. It is smart, has interesting characters and feels as realistic as a medieval fantasy story can feel.\n\nThe replayability is good. There were choices that I had to make that I will explore again to see the new outcome.\nI was able to import my Witcher one savegame and it gave me a few advantages but nothing to write home about. I would still recommend starting with the first of the serie as it is very cheap to find and very pleasant to play.\n\nThe interface was not the greatest but it did not bother me too much either.\n\nOne think that The Witcher series do not offer much is the roaming in the world. First, the maps are not very large and you are constantly limited purposefully by the terrain. At least you cannot kill yourself by falling, you cannot jump except in given spots, you cannot swim. It limits the game play seriously in that regards.\n\nConclusion:\nI played a lot of role playing games based on heroic fantasy, from Baldurs gate a long time ago to Oblivion, Dragon Age and Skyrim. The witcher series remains maybe my favorite to this day. I loved Dragon Age but all the DLC bothered me to no end. I loved Oblivion, I enjoy Skyrim but the story lacks seriously to make it truly a piece of art. On the other hand, I love the possibility of roaming and computer generated side missions in Skyrim that are missing in The Witcher.\nI would still recommend it as a must have and must try to any Heroic fantasy amateur.\n\nLast point: be aware, there are moments of female nudity. Not too frequent but still explicit.

I held off buying the game until the Enhanced Edition was released, so I can't comment on the differences, but The Witcher 2 is an incredible solo RPG and follows up - and improves upon - the original better than most sequels ever do.\n\nThere are already numerous reviews detailing the game, so rather than tell you more of the same, I'll just add a couple of thoughts.  First of all, despite meeting the system requirements listed on the box, I found the game to be nearly unplayable on an old 2.6 GHz Core 2 Quad with 6GB DDR2 and nVidia GeForce 9400GT running Windows 7 64-bit.  Not exactly a gaming workhorse, but it didn't struggle at all with numerous other games, and TW2 brought it nearly to a standstill.  Upgrading the video card to a slightly more modern 630GT made all the difference in the world, allowing me to run at a higher resolution and with more \"eye candy\" enabled without sacrificing performance.  (I also added 2GB of RAM for a total of 8GB, which I doubt made any particular difference.)\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and fast-paced, the world is beautiful and detailed, and character interaction is some of the best I've encountered in an RPG.  Sure, you can't carry on a conversation with every single NPC or stray very far off the beaten path (eg. Elder Scrolls, Gothic, etc.) but rarely does anything feel off-limits.  Speaking of limits, there is virtually no limit to the carnage, cursing, nudity and sexual content, with the latter also being several levels beyond the \"sex cards\" of the original.  As other reviewers have made quite clear, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR KIDS.  The look and feel of TV series like Spartacus and Game of Thrones matched with wildly branching storyline make for an exceptionally immersive experience.\n\nThere is only one glaring complaint I have about TW2, although it's not unique to this game.  I feel as though \"boss\" fights have become a tired gimmick, but without revealing too much, there are definitely some battles where all of Geralt's combat abilities are basically thrown out the window in favor of just repeating a single manuever over and over.  I can think of several such encounters where I felt as though learning the ins and outs of equipment enhancement, alchemy (especially bomb-making) and sign-casting were wasted efforts.  Geralt would seem to become less responsive as well, even though this was neither a performance issue or a legitimate combat effect.  Fortunately, this is largely offset by the otherwise enjoyable combat, but save often to avoid major headaches.\n\nAs I understand it, a third game in the series is now in the works, but having just finished this one and having numerous other plot directions available - and many other games to play before then - I'll probably wait for The Witcher 3 to be offered in an Enhanced Edition as well.", "summary": "A worthy successor to the epic original.", "unixReviewTime": 1372118400}

They abandoned the system used in the first Witcher and instead moved to a weak attack/strong attack type system, but the combat moves are not interruptable, there is no little white targeting dot so you only rely on health bars which pop up which often results in attacking or using the wrong thing. The difficulty of the start of the game is pretty high, not because the enemies are hard, it is because you will often engage multiple enemies at the same time which result in high damage taken, especially when attacked from behind.

It comes with choice of languages including english, plus subtitles on or off in choice of languages, and many customization settings as well for operation. Be sure to go to the project webpage for downloads of fan-written additional story segments to play, and also other extras. Check out the fantasy books that motivated the software team to craft this great work... not too light, not too dark, gritty yet not macabre, and plenty of interesting characters. It's a single-role RPG, not a MMO or pick your character like, for example, Oblivion. But this is one very interesting character and you develop his abilities as you play. It's not a mindless slash-hack, there's a lot of thoughtful development to the storylines here. Oh, and did I say how great the graphics are?

This is a masterpiece of an RPG, one that proudly stands alongside its predecessor as one of the best released in recent times.\n\nThe game continues the adventures of monster-slayer Geralt of Rivia, as he continues to search for the lost pieces of his memory, and continues to get embroiled in a corrupt world of famine, racism, genocide, political corruption, and horrific creatures. Nearly everything that made the first game so great returns here - the strong, well-written narrative, the endlessly intriguing game world, the plethora of things to do, and the deep RPG mechanics that should satisfy both veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nThere are a few key differences here from the first game. Despite being an obviously bigger and more expensive production, it is a much shorter, more compact and streamlined game. This does not make the game any better or worse, but simply different. The game manages to be equally as affecting and epic as the first game, even if you never get to know the world quite as well as you did the first time around. Combat has received a major overhaul, which now resembles the 1:1 combat often found in other sword-wielding, fantasy action RPGs. However, the combat remains incredibly satisfying, and is actually much more challenging this time around, as parrying and dodging have become even more of a necessity alongside the various sword and magic attacks available to Geralt. Inventory is now based on encumbrance as opposed to number of slots, and the alchemy and skill trees have become much easier to manage while retaining all the depth they've always had.\n\nThe game has also received a major graphical overhaul, as environments and character animations are not only a huge step up from the first game, but are among the best of any games out there. The Witcher 2's presentation is simply stunning.\n\nFans of the first game should be very satisfied with this excellent sequel, and The Witcher 2 also functions as a great introduction to this amazing universe, although I would highly recommend playing the original game, The Witcher, if possible. CD Projekt RED is one of the developers to watch going forward into the future, as they have created a game world that has few peers in the industry.

I play primarily FPS games. I occasionally dabble in RPG's. I loved Oblivion. I loved Skyrim. But most of my gaming time is spent on FPS games. As anyone who plays FPS games can tell you, that genre is stale.  Every major FPS game is a sequel, and aside from some minor variations, you realize in about 30 minutes that most FPS games are almost exact clones of all the FPS games that preceded it. So, I look to RPG's for some variety.\n\nWitcher 2 is indeed an RPG, but even within the world of RPG's, it is unique. The Witcher series are based on books written by a polish author. The games are steeped in the mythology of the books, and Witcher 2 simply thrusts you into this world with little explanation.  No baby steps here. You learn from context that your character is a Witcher, which is a supernatural being that folks hire to slay monsters.  The world of the Witcher 2 is vast, detailed, and filled with competing factions with a long history of distrust and racism. Humans detest non-humans (elves and dwarfs). Elves have been subjected to pogroms and massacres, and live in the woods as rebels. The Witcher's world is divided amongst competing kingdoms, and the kings wage wars based on petty differences.  This is a detailed, rich world filled with interesting characters.\n\nWitcher 2 was originally released in 2011 as a PC only game. It was released again in 2012 as the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition on the Xbox 360. The Enhanced Edition added hours of new content, an improved tutorial system, and included some previously released downloadable content. People who owned the original Witcher 2 on PC can go to the GOG.com website and download a 14 GB patch for free, which updated the original witcher 2 to the Enhanced Edition.  Because I am what they call \"frugal,\" I purchased the original Witcher 2 (which is less than the Enhanced Edition) and then downloaded the free patch to update to the Enhanced Edition.\n\nThe game starts with the most amazing CGI cutscene I have ever seen. It is so amazing you will wonder why they don't make whole movies with this technology.  The scene is important because it kick starts the story of Witcher 2 but isn't really placed into context for a while.  (Mild Spoiler alert: the cutscene shows the assassination of King Demavand, which starts the story. End of Spoiler.)\n\nThe story of the Witcher 2 is complex. And violent.  Innocents are slaughtered by their enemies. There is CGI nudity. There are sexual acts that make Mass Effect look like a Disney movie.  This game plays like an R rated movie.  The voice acting is flawless.  The main character's voice is perfect and well done. You don't hear the same annoying lines from NPC's over and over again like you do some other games. (Hello, Skyrim!)  The combat has a learning curve. You fight with a sword, in conjunction with powers (which the game calls \"signs\"). The fighting is real time, and involves a combination of timing your attacks and parries with evasive movements. It looks weird if you watch gameplay movies, but makes perfect sense when you are the one executing the moves. I found the combat quite gratifying and enjoyable. I tried playing the game with my standard keyboard and mouse set-up. I did some research and read that some folks really preferred playing the PC version with the xbox 360 controller.  I switched to that set-up and found the combat much more intuitive. X for a quick sword strike, Y for a stronger attack (for armored enemies or massive gollums), B to use a power (incinerate was my favorite, and A to roll away or towards an enemy. For me, this set-up was much better than my mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe story places the combat in context and gives it meaning.  You level up and develop your character, investing skill points in swordsmanship, powers (signs), or alchemy.  There are different endings, and about 1/3rd of the way through the game, you must pick a path that plays out independently of the path you didn't choose.  The ending I reached explained every loose thread of the complex story. I was very impressed with how much effort and detail went into every facet of this game, from the gameplay and graphics to the story and the story's resolution. You can really tell this game was a labor of love for the developers.  I plan to go back now and play the other path. Two games in one?  Bargain!\n\nIf you would like to play an original game that isn't a rehash of all games that came before it, consider Witcher 2. I did, and came away impressed.", "summary": "A Breath of (DRM free) Fresh Air", "unixReviewTime": 1340064000}

It has excessive violence, gore, cursing, and graphical depictions of nudity and sexual acts as well as drug usage. So you might as well write it off as an adult-oriented game only. With that out of the way, the first chapter (Prologue) of the game is actually the most intense and absorbing that I can remember. It places you right in the action of a siege on the La Valette castle and puts you right at the front lines before, during and after the siege and is very event driven. A few sidequests present themselves, but the focal driving force is the main narrative which moves the game along at a decent clip. The entire prologue is set up like a tutorial of sorts, but one that can be quite punishing; placing you in massive sword battles with up to 10 opponents at a time and various timed action key sequences and a confrontation with a dragon as well as some stealth bits in the castle dungeons. So all in all, it was quite the introduction to the game and I was instantly entranced with the game.\nThe first actual chapter after the prologue is a bit of a breather from the festivities of the prologue. The initial events are exciting but ultimately set up what is to be your 'home base' for the duration of the chapter in the backwater town of Flotsam where corruption is rampant and you come in to help solve problems. The majority of the chapter involves doing various sidequests and slowly moving the main story along at a pace you feel comfortable. However, progress too far and the main story takes over, instantly fails any current sidequests you have going at the moment, and whisks you on a whirlwind journey through the epic climatic scenes of Chapter 1 before progressing onward to chapter 2. So be wary of that. Of the various environments in the game, I actually liked the town of Flotsam and its surrounding forests the most. It seemed very real and majestic to me, and very much middle ages.\nThe second chapter is actually the most interesting story wise. Depending on your fateful choice at the end of the first chapter, you can have wildly different experiences in the second. You can either be in the dwarf city of Vergan or the Kudawni war camp for the duration of chapter 2. But the over-arching storyline of the cursed battlefield looms heavily on whatever you are doing throughout chapter 2. Like the previous chapter, the initial events are exciting and set up your 'home base' for the duration. Proceed too far and the main story takes over and takes you on the straight and narrow for the climatic scenes which transition to chapter 3. I will say, siding with Iorveth is probably the better way to go for chapter 2, since the Roche variant of this chapter isn't nearly as interesting. But that is a matter of personal taste. However, this actually gets flipped in chapter 3, as I will explain in a moment. I feel the dwarf city of Vergan and its various quests are a lot more interesting and provide a lot more background information on the overall story and its villians than being in the war camp. The final few scenes regarding the cursed battle field and the ultimate siege are some of the best interactive cinematic gaming experiences I've had in a long while.\nWith chapter 3, it seems the game is winding down as if the developers were running out of steam and it shows it. Roche actually has the better set of quests here and Iorveth's variant is a bit less stellar and is more or less a straight shot from the opening events to ending, closing events with only a few sidequests to keep you entertained in the meanwhile. With Roche, there are actually 4-5 quests involving political intrique and various double crossings that make his version of chapter 3 the ideal version to experience (if you can suffer through the war camp of chapter 2). So there is a trade off, Roche = stellar chapter 3, not so hot chapter 2. Iorveth = stellar chapter 2, not so hot chapter 3. The culmination of all your decisions ends here in chapter 3 where the results of your choices end in the summit held in Loc Muinne and what set up the epilogue. Despite a rather slow introduction to this chapter (when compared to the previous two), the finale more than makes up for it with a very tense showdown with an old 'friend' whom you met in the prologue.\nThe epilogue is rather a coda to the game rather than a fully playable set piece like the prologue was. It basically wraps up the plot holes in the story with a huge story exposition bomb should you want to get deep into it. Otherwise, you can end the epilogue quickly and get one of 16 endings. (more like 4 endings with 4 variations each)\nThe extra addition of the arena is a nice bonus and really taxes your skills as a Witcher to survive all 30 rounds of the arena with no saving. You must really micromanage your equipment, potions and level up perks to make it through alive.\nAll in all, I was happy with this game purchase and I am glad I got it even though I had very little knowledge on the game. The sole driving force of my purchase, of course, was the DRM-free, non-account activating aspect of the Enhanced Edition. I can safely say that you pop the DVD in, install your game, take the DVD out, pack it up on the shelf with your other games and play it normally any time you want. Highly recommended for those who like action-adventure games with RPG elements and who aren't shy around adult themes, blood and content. You will find a very respectable story here that does not insult your intelligence and makes it worth the price of admission.", "summary": "A Personal Experience...", "unixReviewTime": 1338508800}

I pre ordered last year, and played through the game.  I chose Roche the first time, and it was a great game, albeit not particularly balanced in the beginning.  It was pretty difficult initially, and after you level up, it becomes a bit easier to deal with, but its never quite straight forward.\n\nThe story is EPIC, most likely one of the deepest, nuanced, and complex stories ever told by the Video Game art form.  There have been some great story driven games (Bioshock comes to mind), but Witcher and Witcher 2 especially are just remarkable.  The choices you make matter, and the game can be replayed over and over again with different results (if you have the patience)\n\nWitcher 1 had a novel swordplay mechanism, where timing and controls had to be very coordinated.  It was a bit tough to get used to, but once past it, it became truly clever, easy and addictive.  Witcher 2 refines that approach, but also complicates it, by changing some fundamental dynamics in the way swordplay is accomplished.  I find it less satisfying than Witcher 1, but still basically good.\n\nPotions are an area where CD Projekt took a painful step backwards.  Potions are an integral part of the game, and in Witcher 2, potions MUST be consumed BEFORE a fight, so you sometimes have to go backwards several saves, just in order to take potions.  This is by no means the end of the world, but it makes it somewhat annoying, when you stumble into an ambush, and just start dying over and over and over again.\n\nGameplay is mostly good, however, there is NO fast travel, which means you wander around aimlessly quite often.  That, combined with an awkward map system, make it draining to look for quest locations sometimes, as there is simply NO WAY to know where you need to go.  Kind of dumb actually, and it didn't need to be that way.  It appears that if you read certain books, then some portions of the map activate, although I cannot confirm this, because it seemed to be pretty inconsistent.\n\nNOW FOR THE BAD.\n\nMost video games have their own subtle twist on controls, saves, and combat.  However, Witcher 2 does a few things which make it extraordinarly frustrating at times, and caused me to just walk away from it for days at a time.\n\n1) Trapped Boss Battles:  I generally hate boss battles, because they waste time, disrupt the story, and are usually just annoying. When there's some super tight secret to beating a boss, it can be more annoying.  Witcher 2 bosses are not that difficult in general, but they are some of the most frustrating boss battles in video games.  In certain cases, many controls are disabled (dodging, potions, saves, etc), and to add insult to injury, you are TRAPPED, with nowhere to hide, or regain health.  So you just have to spend tons of time finding the exact combination of moves, etc.  It is horrible in many cases.  You can dose up on potions ahead of time, but when the battle comes, the potions are no longer there, and you can't do anything except die, over and over and over and over.\n\n2) Disabled controls when you need them most:  There are numerous portions of the game, where important controls are disabled (dodging, saves, etc), which causes you to have to replay those sections a zillion times in order to figure out a new set of control constraints.  I just hate this.  You invest massive amounts of time trying to master a set of controls to play a game, so you can enjoy it, and every so often, the controls completely change to something completely different.  Just terrible\n\n3) Massively confusing character management:  Witcher 1 was pretty straight forward.  You could just do stuff....  Witcher 2, has tons of things that are totally and needlessly complex.  I still haven't figured out how to use mutagens at all.  Selecting specific ingredients for potions is massively annoying and confusing.  Character building trees and simply bizzare, where you have to make choices you really don't want or need.\n\n4) Disabled Saves and many other features at random times:  Sometimes, you'll be wandering around, and the music will start going into battle mode and saves, potions and other features are disabled.  But there're no enemies around.  And you are locked out from many actions, from meditation, to potion creation, to character development.  Makes NO sense.\n\n5) Finally, inconsistent control response.  I could probably live with most issues, but this one is just a sin.  There are many times where no matter which keyboard or mouse button you push, nothing happens.  So you die, and die, and die, over and over and over and over.  Just a PITA.  I just don't understand what the problem is here.\n\nThere are plenty of other warts on this otherwise remarkable piece of entertainment software.  The enhanced version is very refined, I had no real bugs or crashes (on a massively overclocked CPU/GPU machine w Windows 7 64bit).  Other than painful boss battles (where I sighed after a while when a boss appears), and just bizzare controls, the game is fantastic.  For me, I had to take breaks once in a while, as the game was exhausting from the control, map and navigation problems.

I'm going to review it from the perspective of an action-RPG game lover, and as someone who's put a few hours into it.\n\nThe story seems excellent. It's a mature game and an interesting world. My problems revolve around the user-nonfriendliness of the game for those new to the Witcher series like myself, and for people who are used to other action-RPG's.\n\nFirst of all, there is no tooltip for the abilities (signs) that have words that only exist in this game world. For example, the signs such as Axii, Aard, Igni, Yrden, Quen. These are simply \"spells\" in other games with English names such as \"fireball\", \"turn friendly\" etc. Unfortunately, without any tooltip or in-game documentation (except during their SINGLE moments in the tutorial when they are mentioned), you will end up having to Google them like I did. Having to exit a game just to google a feature in it is frankly ridiculous. Perhaps they left any description out for \"immersion\" reasons, but since they only show up on a game control screen that breaks immersion anyway, this would be a pretty silly reason to do so. In fact the only sign I could remember right off the bat is \"Igni\" because it's the root of \"Ignite\" and it burns. I STILL don't remember the rest and I've been playing the game for a few hours now. Very new-user-hostile. First star lost.\n\nThe second new-user-hostile thing is the control scheme. In the tutorial, they mention (briefly) the Q key, the control key, the Z key, and a few other keys that do various things. Then later on you need to use your amulet and forgot the key and... wait? Where the hell is the in-game keyboard reference? I go through the menus looking for a control scheme reference. THERE IS NONE. Really? If there is in fact one, it's certainly not in an obvious location. Off I go to Google... And another star is lost.\n\nThe last 2 criticisms are a taste thing and I'm only deducting 1 star for the both of them: The talent tree builds, and Alchemy.\n\nTalents: They are, eh, very uninteresting. Examples include: +1 to combat regen. +1 to vitality. Ability to parry. +1 to vigor... I mean really? There is nothing here that will make you go \"WHOA!\". So if you're raised on the likes of Skyrim, WoW and other sorts of games where getting entirely new abilities on a regular basis is a common and much-looked-forward-to thing, prepare to be disappointed. Or, at least, to focus on the story and choices you make instead of your \"power building\".\n\nAlchemy: I have always hated alchemy in other games. Spend a lot of time harvesting a bunch of weeds just to make a few potions that have limited value. The difference here is that in other games, Alchemy is not necessary. You can pretty much safely overlook it: WoW, Skyrim, Amalur, anything else. Here, alchemy seems absolutely necessary. Ugh, I hate alchemy, and I hate being forced to pull weeds instead of driving the story forward. And then to use a potion, you have to \"Meditate\", breaking immersion again... So like I said, a taste thing. Alchemy sucks, your opinion may vary.\n\nI may update this review after giving this game some more time, but the initial experience is very bad and contrary to what all the hardcore people were saying.

There is no internet connection requirement whatsoever, no key codes, not even a disc check.  Thank you to CDPR and WB for respecting their Customers.\n- All EE contents included\n- 2 game DVDs and 1 soundtrack CD are all in the same case\n- The game guide includes walkthrough for the EE contents\n- Better cover art\n- Standard DVD type slip-on cover.\n\nORIGINAL VERSION (published by Atari, or Namco Bandai for the Euro version)\n\n- Comes with limited online activation DRM scheme.  However, please note that the DRM can easily be removed by patching or upgrading to the EE altogether (to deployed Military Members, please be aware that either way, a solid internet connection is required)\n- EE contents not included.  Please note that this is not a patch or a DLC; rather, the entire game - reworked with the EE contents - needs to be downloaded (free of charge), which is about 15GB.\n- The game DVDs (2 ea.) are in one DVD case\n- 1 bonus materials DVD and 1 sound track CD are in another DVD case (separately from the game DVDs)\n- The game guide has better binding, but walkthrough for EE contents is not included.\n- The map is slightly longer in length by about 2.5 inches and contains 1 additional illustration on each side.\n- The origami-like paper craft and the story-related \"A Hog Named Henselt\" pamphlet are included (not available in the EE version)\n- Thicker bookcase-type cover.\n- As the description for the OV indicated, there is also a Temerian coin included. However, since I moved a couple months ago and can't find mine right now, I can't confirm this.\n\nAs for the additional EE contents in specific, here are the improvements that I noticed:\n\n- Additional cutscenes for the intro, in between-chapters, and post-credit to improve narration.\n- Better sounds overall. Eg. Geralt's voice volume is now higher (he seemed to be whispering in the OV), and additional sound-offs like \"Oorah\" or \"Hooah\" can now be heard throughout the military encampments, exercises, and operations (just like the source novels, TW2 is full of anachronism - 'this I like.')\n- The additional side quests in Act 3 for both Roche's and Iorveth's paths.\n- The side quest \"Little Sisters\" in Roche's path is now much easier to follow.\n- For those who dislike QTEs (quick time events - I call it sequential button mashing) now there is an option to toggle it off in boss fights.\n- You now can actually see the full impact of the major decisions made in regards to Temeria, Kaedwen, Vergern, and the sorcerers/sorceresses as shown in the end of Act 3 in Loc Muine (in the OV, you only heard about what happened)- and also in the epilogue as narrated by Dandelion.\n- Just for those who must know, there is now one additional possible sexual encounter in Iorveth's path.  New total: 3 possible encounters for Iorveth's path vs. 1 possible encounter for Roche's path.\n\nNote:  For those who already played the OV and now just want to play the additional EE side quests, after downloading and merging the EE pack, load up a game save at the end of Act 2, and the side quests will be available and properly loaded in Act 3.\n\nTo the game itself, if you are not aware of it by now, first and foremost, TW2 is a game designed from the ground up specifically for the mature Gamers.  Indeed, please keep the children away and out of both visual and audible range - because there are scenes and references of profanity, nudity, sexual intercourse, rape, torture, mutilation, and violent death here - even more than in TW1.\n\nAs an action RPG, TW2 is very good.  Similar to TW1, leveling up is well timed; that is, as you progress through the story, you are leveling up at the right time and the right place.  Thus, there is never a need to grind to level up (unless perhaps you are playing on \"dark mode\" difficulty, which is extremely challenging combat-wise).\n\nIn terms of combat, unlike TW1, TW2 is now a full-out action game that requires precise timing and hand-eye coordination.  As is, it is definitely not easy to grasp for the novice or casual Gamers.  However, if you keep in mind that there are always more than one way to overcome the challenge in combat, and you are willing to experiment, then it will be very rewarding when you discover your own way to success and domination.\n\nFor me, the highlight of TW2 is the story elements that make it stands head and shoulder above the rests. In addition to the aforementioned unflinchingly mature themes, TW2 is one of those extremely rare games that offer true branching story paths.  To be more precise, depending on the choice you made at the end of Act 1, almost all of Act 2 will play out differently with a different story and in a different location. In addition, about 1/3 of Act 3 will also be different. Needless to say, the replay value is way off the chart here. And in order to see and to appreciate the scope of the whole story, you will want to play both paths.\n\nLast but not least, the complex and layered story of TW2 is firmly set in a world saturated with different shades of gray.  Thus, the decisions to be made - which, in conjunction with your own logic and morality and along with the half-lie and half-truth that you gathered - is neither right nor wrong ... There are only consequences. And regardless of where you stand on the notion of 'the end justifies the means', tread carefully, because you may need to do just that.\n\nIn general, in spite of which version of TW2 one chooses to go with - whether the OV or the EE, it is still an excellent game.  In particular, TW2EE earned 4.5 stars in my book - to which I rounded up in appreciation of CD Projekt Red.

There are total 16 different endings with 2 major branches and 14 additional permutations branching off those 2 major branches.  Single playthrough will take around 40 hours and you surely want to play at least once more for the major change of the plot development.\n\nIn the days of eco-case with no manual, online pass, paid to play DLCs and DRM now firmly spreaded to consoles from PC, it is almost insane in the eyes of major game publishers from financial backgrounds, dying to see second-hand market dead and force their wills on the customers, to see a small foreign developers releasing free upgrades and DLCs for their customers and openly speak against the current DRM trend, but here we go again, CDProjekt doing the impossible.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go visit world wide web dot gog dotcom and get the DRM-free download version of the new TW2EE with all the bonus contents that includes manual, game guide, soundtrack, map and poster if you have not purchased the game.  It's also a sister company of CDProjekt and all of the retro games available at the site are DRM-free.\n\nFor the new retailed version published by WB, I haven't been able to confirmed any DRM yet, however, CDProjekt recently reassured that they will not put DRM on any of their games as they have proven time and again.  Then again, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the retailed version comes out with DRM, at least initially because it's WB.\n\nThe Witcher series is one of my three most favorite CRPG games along with TES series and Gothic Trilogy.  It is CRPG lovers' dream comes true.  If you missed it, go buy it now.

Well, the load times would be a great place to start. Just like in FF Chronicles, one of the games has great load times, and the other is plagued horribly. FF6 has the worst load times I have ever experienced, even worse than all other ps1 games which have BETTER graphics and contain just as much if not MORE information ( remember Wild Arms? That game was huge, AND it had better graphics than FF6, but it's load times were very, very short, almost unnoticcable, so what the heck!?). Every time you enter a battle you are greeted with 5 + seconds of looking at a black screen, sound fun to you? I didn't think so. Every time you enter the menu you are greeted with another 5+ seconds of load time. Sure, it's only 5 seconds, but once you experience it, you will feel how long five seconds CAN feel, especially when you are used to fast-paced games (the load times are much slower than the PS1 ff's)But on to the games themselves...\n\nFinal Fantasy 6- Music- 5/5, Fun 0/5, Story 5/5 Gameplay 0/5, overall-1/5 This game is a masterpiece, the greatest RPG ever released on any system. However, given the poor load times, the fun value of this game is whiped out. Seriously, it's a chore to play it. If you have a SNES system i'd dish out 30 bucks for it if you can find it on Amazon or somewhere else. The SNES version has blazing fast load times, the graphics are better, and the whole experience is so much better. I think it is a terrible idea to release a masterpiece with flaws that whipe out any fun while playing the game. Basically, when you buy this you might as well save your time and throw the FF6 disk away, or sell it towards a SNES FF3 cartridge.\n\nFinal Fantasy 5- Music 5/5 Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Fun 4/5 Overall 5/5 Now this is why this game is worth the price. FF5 is without a doubt a masterpiece, and the version on FF Anthology is great. The load times are pretty fast, the sound is great, and it has the Job system very much like ff Tactics. The job system is a phenomenal idea, and FF5 executes it perfectly. Some hate this game, but I think 5 is easily just as good as 9. It isn't as good as 4, 6, 7, or 8, or heck even Tactics, but you have to realize that FF games are so good that even excellent isn't good enough, and this one is a masterpiece, like most the others. FF5 is much more difficult than any other FF game, even much harder than 4, and you will have to battle quite often for long periods of time, and sometime this can be discouraging if you aren't into battling for a while, but other than that it is a good game. It starts off pretty slow, but as you progress it gets much better, so don't lose interest right away, just wait it out and see if it gets better for you. (When i first got ff Anthology i didn't care a whole lot about 5, but when i got around to progressing through it I found it was a great game)\n\nOverall, This version of FF6 might as well not even have been issued, but it is definitely worth it for FF5, and 15-20 bucks is extremely cheap for these two games, just don't expect FF6 to be as fast as the FF3 you remember playing as a kid for Super Nintendo. (Still, I don't get it.

I suppose some might see it as the companies just trying to squeeze more money from old games, but I love being able to play these games on new systems, and the addition of new features is always fun to experience.\n\nAs far as collections go, this is a very good one. Final Fantasy 6, originally 3, is a classic game, and considered by some to be the best FF ever. I can't say I think it's the best, but it is definitely an exceptional game that was even more remarkable when it was first released. It does already seem dated in many ways. At the same time, this is the final game in the series where you can experience the classic, 2D FF that many fans of the series have grown up with.\n\nThis game does have an excellent cast of characters, and one of the better storylines in the series. The espers, the first real summon monsters, are really cool, and theres somewhere around 30 of them, much more than any other game, which I like. Each character has unique abilities and weapons, which makes for great variety. A very fun old school RPG.\n\nThe graphics were amazing at the time, but already seem pretty dated. The sound as well. The music that was written for the game is some of Uematso's best, but the sound capabilities of the SNES are just too dated. If they improved anything, I wish they would have improved sound quality a bit. Also, the CG scenes they added were disappointing to me. They weren't that badly done, but I thought that they would be peppered throughout the game at the appropriate spots, which they weren't. They were only at the beginning and end, which I find disappointing. I guess they wanted the actual experience of playing the game to be identical to how it was on the SNES. I wouldn't have minded some small improvements, personally. Overall, they did a good job.\n\nFF 5 was a real surprise, and it was great to play a brand new old style FF, never before released in the US. Lots of the reviews on Amazon say that it is really a sub-par game. I have to say I strongly disagree...I think its a great FF game. If you enjoyed FF 4 and 6, I think you'll definitely like 5. The graphics and sound are similar to FF 4. The gameplay is what makes the game so good though. You can switch your characters between the variety of job classes like in FF Tactics or FF X-2, and learn a large variety of different skills, then mix and match them. It's a very primitive form of the job class system, sure, but it's still really cool, considering the age of the game. I also really enjoyed the story of the game...it was about as good as FF 4. Theres a part where you're navigating through a graveyard of pirate ships infested with ghosts and zombies that is totally classic. I would definitely recommend giving FF 5 a chance. It is old and outdated, but definitely lives up to the quality of the FF series.\n\nNow, a quick word about the music disc...it's pathetic. An absolute waste of time. If anyone could actually listen to that disc and get into the music on it, I'd say you have serious issues. It's tinny SNES sound, taken directly from the games. I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw some real orchestrated versions (they are available in Japan) of the songs on here...that would have been great. Furthermore, they chose a bunch of the worst songs to include on the disc and left out many of the best. Terrible.\n\nBut, you won't be buying this collection for the music disc. The games are what matters, and they are quality, faithful ports of the originals. Highly recommended for people who want to walk down memory lane with some great old games.", "summary": "An Unknown and a Classic...both Great", "unixReviewTime": 1107043200}

I think this is a great thing as you can't just use attack every round. The job and ability system is awesome. You can learn abilitys on jobs and use them for other jobs. You could have a sorcerer have the power to store one of his attacks. You could have a knight cast demi. You can have a barbarian who guards other members. It is really cool and fun as you stay with basically 4 characters. These 4 characters can change jobs and look different for each one. The fun thing is getting to choose who does what. The story is great, as it should be. The characters interact and have personalitys.\nNow, I stopped playing ff5 half way through because it is much longer than other final fantasys. It also has a saving issue. Sometimes when opening the save menu you will see the pixels go crazy. You have to exit the save menu a couple times or just select save by pressing down once than x 3 times. This bug is kinda annoying at times but it can be fixed. It does have high points though that should not be overlooked.\nFF6 is good. It has much better sprites. It is different though. You can't just have your 4 favorite characters as you will probably switch it up alot. I liked the characters, but they do tend to become useless. Most of them do. I never use Cyan or whatever. The challenge is moderately hard. It is not as challenging as FF5, but more challenging than ff7. There are a ton of summons. I read Expert Gamer sometimes and they have a whole page filled with summons in one issue. The battles are relatively fun, but can be won easily with Edgar. It is so easy to use tools that it is almost a joke. I stopped playing this one half way through also as I got distracted.\nIf you like classic 2d games, these are pretty good. I am gonna finish ff5 after starting over and plan to do the same with 6. They are both good and the editor said \"ff5 should of stayed unreleased\". When you say something like that, you clearly did not play the game. It is innovative and fun.

Well back when we had NES/SNES,  they released Final Fantasy 1, Final Fantasy IV, and Final Fantasy VI and renamed them to 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  So once Final Fantasy VII(probably the best RPG ever created and I don't throw that around lightly) came out in 1997, people went \"whoa, 7? what about 4 to 6?\" Enter Anthology, Chronicles and Origins and the recently announced Final Fantasy III remake for the DS. This review deals with Final Fantasy Anthology, containing V and VI\n\nFinal Fantasy V\n\nStory: Bartz, Reina, Garaf and Faris have to take down X-Death(dumbest FF villain name ever) from controlling 4 crystals. Maybe it's my status as a post VI-player but it must've been irritating saving those damn crystals over and over.\n\nGraphics: They're pretty standard really, I mean this is the Super Nintendo so they're not great, even for SNES standards. The FMV's of course are cool.\n\nMusic: Pretty good but not spectacular like IV or VI.\n\nGameplay: It excels for one reason: The Job System. For the first time, you can customize your characters rather than just being one particular class. Master one job, move to another. The story is eh, music's ok, but play it cause it's a FF.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI\n\nStory: They're existed once powerful beings called Espers many centuries ago. Now they're gone and the world is in an Industrial Revolution-like setting with airships and weaponry. A soldier of the Empire, Terra, was used for battle and after being free of mind control, joins a group of resistance members planning to take down the Empire.\n\nGraphics: For the most part the graphics are great for the SNES era. They're still not as sharp/detailed as Chrono Trigger or even colorful like Yoshi's Island but they work in the end.\n\nSound/Music: The music here is usually cited as the best Uematsu soundtrack he's done. While personally I go with VII, VI is by no means a flawed soundtrack. There's tons of great themes: catchy ones, emotional ones and epic ones like Terra's Theme, Forever Rachel, Aria de Mezzo Caraterre and Dancing Mad.\n\nA HUGE cast list with 14 playable characters, still the largest cast in a Final Fantasy game. While it's nice to have variety, some don't get as much story as they should've. Ones like Celes, Terra, Locke and Setzer have substanstial backstory while others might just join your party and that's it. The game brings in the Esper System. It's not a wild departure like Junctioning but essentially you can equip an Esper to use in battle and after each battle you get points to learn a spell. Learn it and on to the next one. Finish them all and you can pick someone else.\n\nWhile V is merely playable for the Job system and the fact it's a FF game, VI is required playing for an RPG fan.", "summary": "One classic RPG, one unreleased gem", "unixReviewTime": 1069977600}

FFVI first appeared on the SNES, but was known as Final Fantasy III at the time (it was the third Final Fantasy to make it to America, but the sixth overall in Japan).  Final Fantasy V was only released in Japan and Anthology makes the American debut of the game.  Ive been a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, so I was extremely happy that I was now able to play these games on the Playstation.  It was nice to have all of my Final Fantasy on the same system.  There have been complaints about the loading time between battles and menu screens, and while the loading times are not great (or even good), they did not distract me at all while playing the games.  These were just minor complaints for me.\nFinal Fantasy V:\nAs I stated above, this is the first time that Final Fantasy V was playable in the United States.  Graphically, the game is similar to Final Fantasy IV (the one with Cecil and Golbez), but there is a significant difference.  The difference is that there is a job based leveling system now.  This predates Final Fantasy Tactics, but it is similar (less refined, perhaps).  As you progress through the game, your abilities in battle depend on what job class you have chosen to be, and mastering multiple job classes is key to beating the game.  The story is somewhat of a let down after Final Fantasy IV.  I feel this is one of the weaker games in the series, but it is still fun.\nFinal Fantasy VI:\nThis is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time.  While I have loved most of the games, and enjoyed the rest, this one stands first in my heart for the Final Fantasy series.  This game has good graphics for the SNES era, and a long, involved story dealing with magical creatures called Espers and the greed of some humans to steal that magical power.  The story does not center directly on any one character, but a case could be made for Terra, Celes, Locke, and perhaps Edgar as the fourth lead.  The absence of a true lead character adds to the development of the story since it doesnt follow one character but follows a plotline where character move in and out of the story arc.

Look for more about FF VI (called III for the SNES) in my review for it in the SNES section when it was originally released. I will focus this review more on FF V, since this was the first time it was released out of Japan....\nFinal Fantasy V was originally released in Japan in 1992. Squaresoft was planning on releasing it in the U.S., but it was deemed \"too tough\" for American audiences. Then they planned on releasing it for the PC and calling it \"Final Fantasy Extreme,\" but that idea was scrapped as well. It is now finally available in its original form, along with FF VI, as Final Fantasy Anthology.\nI found FF V to be a pretty good FF, and if I were just reviewing it without FF VI, I would give it 4 stars. However, being that both of these FF's were released together for the price of one, I have to give it five stars. FF V has the Job System like in FF I and FF III (NES FF III which has yet to be released out of Japan). The difference between the Job System in FF I and FF V's Job System is that you can switch character classes at any time, and you learn new skills based on which class you are currently using by getting AP. The story is above average, and as said before, FF V is very challenging. Music is also up to par with other FF's, so what is the minor problem, you ask?\nI felt that FF V had less character development than other FF's at the time (IV and VI). This would've been fine if FF V was released in the time period of the NES FF's, but that's not the case. Don't get me wrong; while it does have some character development, the character development in IV and VI were much better.

Up until this point, most RPG villains were \"Mwa, ha ha, I'm Evil!!!\" villains who were evil to have someone evil in the story. In FF6, Emperor Ghestalt and Kefka are deeper than that. One realizes too late that his greed has doomed him, the other is insane because he was the subject of magical/medical experiments.

This game was first released in the USA for the SNES console.  Even then the music in this game was comparable to that of games played on the PSX, the 32-bit Sony system.  The graphics are also great, 3-dimensional.  Besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile.  It's a long one!  There's so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that it's almost unbelievable.  It's a wonder why I didn't choose this one to be #1 instead of FFII.  I guess it's because in my mind FFII is the one that started the greatness of the FF series.  Since FFII, the FF series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good.  Not to bag on FFI, but the story was rather weak and besides, it was on the 8-bit Nintendo system.  If you have been let down by any Final Fantasy you've ever played, this is the one to play.  There's so many different characters you can get in this game as well, but you have to know how to get them.  My favorite is the Ninja, because he has a mind of his own, and you never know what he's going to say or do.\n  My second topic is Japan's FFV.  The only reason I gave FF Anthology 4 stars is due to the greatness of FFVI.  This FFV game though... in a word... sucks.  It's the worst FF game I have ever played.  The enemies are too difficult.  They give you too many character jobs.  And finally, the game is just boring.  The graphics aren't any better than USA's FFII if not worse.  To me this game is like FF Tactics crossed with FFII.

You can have fun going through the game again using different combinations of jobs. If you have never played FF5 or FF6 prior to buying this anthology, play 5 first because it will set you up for 6. Now, onto FF6. I feel this is the best RPG ever. Though the modern Final Fantasies offer better graphics, bigger story lines, ect, FF6 is the greatest of all time. When it was released on the SNES as FF3, it was ground breaking. It blew everything out of the water with its interactive story line, personable characters, and awesome battle system. So for its time, FF6 is untouchable. The story line is linear, most of the time you know where you are supposed to be going and what you are supposed to be doing, but at the same time you are on your toes because you can't tell what will happen next. The music will blow you away to. It really adds to the effect of the game. FF6 is also a long game, first time I played it on the SNES, it took me 80hrs to beat. Once you know the game inside and out, you can do it in 20hrs. The difficulty is just right as well. Most people will be able to get through this game without having to get a guide. That's how an RPG should be. It should make you think, but not make you have to look up answers on the net or in a guide. If you are an RPG fan, and have PS1 or PS2, buy this game.

Final Fantasy VI has been re-released, keeping intact the entire game as it was back then, with Final Fantasy V as a special bonus.\nPeople introduced to the FF series at part VII might not be able to get past the graphics, which were fine for them time but lousy by today's standards. But for the less cynical player, this is the holy grail of RPGs. This is proof that less is more, and the music in these games rivals anything that came later in the series. Having said that, the later installments in the series are great, but it is important not to forget where it all started.\nFinal Fantasy V is a great game, it's big disadvantage being that it is packaged alongside part VI, so gamers will inevitably compare it to FFVI. It is a typical FF game, meaning that you are assured a great game at the least. The \"job skills\" add a nice twist, and the story, albeit linear, can hold it's own with the best of the RPGs.\nFinal Fantasy VI, as you have read in countless reviews, is probably the most engaging and emotionally involved game in the series. The characters all have likeable personalities, and their individual stories are very enrossing. As the game progresses, the player becomes more involved in their lives. The story is the game's strongest point, while the music is a milestone for any video game. Anybody who dismisses it as \"just a game\" should take\na closer look. Completing this game will become your life.\nThe really good Squaresoft games have an anoying habit of falling out of print quickly, making this game in particular hard to find, let alone at a reasonable price. Anyone who still shops around for SNES games knows this, as well do the people who have tried to find the FF Anthology at their game shop, only to be met with \"Sorry, it's no longer available\". This is really sad because there are many people who will not get to experience these games, and will go on thinking that the FF series never got better than  part VII or IX. All I can say is that is you are lucky enough to find a copy, grab it, or else order it online.

Asteriods, Centipede, even Frogger have been updated.  Well here are two games that haven't.  They are the same as when they were released on the Super Nintendo or Super Famicom.  Although they have been added to.  Beautiful CG animations have been added to the beginning of both games.  The only beef I have is that the characters in the CG look really, really pale.  I mean ghostly pale.  The music CD that they added was also very poorly planned.  They slapped on music from FF5 and the beginning of the second disk of FF6's soundtrack.  Why didn't they take the themes of the characters?  Those were the good songs from FF6 not \"The Magic House\" or \"Dark World.\"  Now to do the games themselves.  FF5: A solid game.  Those players that played FF Tactics will find that there is a job system in this game as well (jobs originated in FF3 for those who care).  After you find one of the four crystals you have the ability to have more jobs come availible to you.  There are 21 different jobs to have from Ninja to Hunter to the trusty Red Mage.  Some of the jobs are really good, others are really bad.  They aren't very well balanced unfortunetly.  As you fight battles you can Points, kinda like Job Points in Tactics.  After you get enough you can a level in that job and get another ability related to that job.  The music hasn't been updated at all.  It is the original Super Nintendo MIDI sounds.  I hate MIDI sounds.  Especially when it sounds MIDI.  The graphics are old school( they will remind you of the block backgrounds in the old RPGs.  Gameplay is very good.  The bosses are very challenging (although there are some that are pushovers).  There are three worlds to explore as well.  It's a fun game and will bring back a lot of nostalgia to those you remember Super Nintendo.  FF6:  The best of the Final Fantasies.  Anyone who says any differently is a fool (I'm sorry if this offends anyone.)  The music is absolutely beautiful.  It may of come from a 16-bit system but it still is the best I've heard.  In Final Fantasy 6 you must face the evil Empire who is bent on using magic to take over the world.  It's your typical RPG from the Super Nintendo era.  There are 12 characters plus two bonus characters that have their own unique abilities.  It's kinda like the job system only without a lot of freedom in who learns what.  Examples the thief Locke can steal, the Magic Soldier Celes can absorb magic and add the MP cost to her own MP.  There are many branches and many plot twists.  There also battles where you actually act out a military campaign.  These are really hard though.  Magic is learned through beings called Espers (the beginning of materia and GFs) and this could be cool but too many Espers have the same spells and too many only give you one and they are the only one that give you it.  Example Crusader with Merton.  Gameplay is standard Final Fantasy.  No surprises there.  All in all.  Final Fantasy Anthology is a must have game for all SquareSoft fans.  If you want to get on the RPG scene I also recommend this game.  It isn't as hungup on graphics and all these special fetures like the newer games are.  It is story and gameplay.  The two most important things in an RPG.  These are the games that will get you started on RPGs.", "summary": "Two great games for the price of one!  Hot dog!", "unixReviewTime": 993859200}

I feel as though even \"new-school\" gamers who played FF7 first would find these games entertaining.  Now as far as the comment in the editorial about FF5, this game is the hardest in the series, next to the FF3 that Japan got (for the original NES).  The bosses are hard, and mastering the job system in this game takes a lot of effort.  Try going through this game without dying on a few bosses and you can consider yourself an FF expert.\nMy hat's off to Square for releasing these games to us hardcore gamers in North America.  FF VI is arguably the best RPG in the 16-bit genre, and FF V, technically being a new game to North America, make this an unbeatable package.  Square must know this, because they're doing it again with Final Fantasy Chronicles (FF IV and Chrono Trigger).  Smart move if you ask me.

The SNES version and PS version are essentially the same. THIS REVIEW ONLY DEALS WITH FINAL FANTASY 6. I have played some of Final Fantasy 5 on an emulator, but not enough to do a review. I have played, to some degree, Final Fantasies 1 - 9. Of all these Final Fantasy games, I would have to say that FINAL FANTASY 6 IS THE BEST TURN-BASED RPG EVER! Some people say that the music is not all that great. I disagree. Yes, it is sometimes repetitive, BUT IT SETS THE MOOD, unlike lots of games out there. ESPECIALLY the first two tunes when you start the final battle, which is really divided into 4 or 5 parts. Every time I hear those tunes I KNOW that I'm at the ending boss. The character development is OUTSTANDING. Most novels would be hard-pressed to come up with such an interesting group. Locke, Setzer, Cyan, Terra, Shadow, Celes, Edgar, Sabin, Umaro, Relm, Strago, Gogo, and Mog. If you've played the game, you just need to LOOK at these names and you INSTANTLY know who they are. The storyline is AMAZING. Magic has been outlawed, but there are some who would like to bring it back and replace technology with it. There are some parallels to Star Wars and the Wheel of Time in here. Eventually you join a rebellion against the evil Kefka. But two of the best parts in the game are: 1--when you get to the opera house for the first time. 2--when the ENTIRE face of the earth is changed and you must start from SCRATCH. I LOVE that part. It is so NONLINEAR. You have to find all your buddies ALL OVER AGAIN, but you can do it in almost any order you want. Sure, the graphics are outdated on this, but GRAPHICS don't make a game, THE STORYLINE DOES. And there is no denying that the storyline in this game is TOP-NOTCH. Final Fantasy 7 and 9 come VERY close, but no cigar. Nobuo Uematsu really put his whole heart into this game, turning out some of the best video game music ever written.

It was an incredible game, by anyone's standards.  But it cost 70 dollars.  Here, we have the opportunity to buy this as well as the never-released before in the US Final Fantasy V, along with bonus features, for 40 dollars!\nThe games certainly lack the graphical polish of the games of today.  But that is irrelevant - they offer great gameplay, great music, and most importantly, great stories.  It is rather obvious that FF 6 is the more sophisticated of the two games, but FF 5 has its own charms.  In particular, anyone who has played Final Fantasy Tactics will recognize the job system.\nFF 6 represented a new path for Square in the RPG department.  There was a focus on more mature themes and, unlike most other RPGs, there was no main character.  Their stories interwove wonderfully and seeing how the characters related to each other was one of the highlights of the game.  The gameplay is solid - each character offers their own distinct traits for use during combat, unlike the later FFs (i.e., 7 and 8) and there is an incredible amount of stuff to do in this game.  The music is also considered by many to be the best of the FF series.\nFF 5 was also a great game.  While it lacked the in-depth characters and the complexity of the next FF, it does excel in all those areas nevertheless.  Plus this game has Gilgamesh.  It's worth playing just to see Gilgamesh.\nThe bonus materials included on the discs are also excellent.  There wasn't much for FF5, except for the introductory CG sequence (and maybe the ending, I'm not sure).  As for FF6, they added a section where you can see dozens of pieces of artwork for the remake of the game, as well as convenient tables of skills and monsters in the game.\nThe additional music CD isn't great, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the set at all.  If you're one of those that got started on the Final Fantasy series through 7 or 8, be sure to check this set out.

One was a mind-numbingly awful shark hunter game, and the other was Carnivores.  To my suprise (Which is still intact today), Carnivores is a suprisingly good budget shooter, well worth its bargin bin price.\n\nCarnivores takes place in the far future, where you are the newest client of a dino-hunting corporation that's set up on a planet in space.  Yes, the story is non-existant, but at least they tried to give a solid reason why you're hunting dinosaurs with a shotgun.\n\nFor your dino hunting adventures, you get to hunt with three weapons.  A shotgun thats powerful (but very noisy), a silent crossbow that features a complex aiming system, and the powerful but limited sniper rifle.  Although you only get three weapons, thats more then enough for plenty of dinosaur hunting action.  One feature I really liked is that you can choose to hunt with sedative rounds (tranquilizers), which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it, thus earning you more points.\n\nThe dinosaurs you hunt are varied, each offering a uniuqe challenge.  The Parasarlophosis for example, is harmless, but has an excellent sense of hearing and can detect you from a mile away, making it almost impossible to find one.  The Triceratops is peaceful, but if you disturb it (or shoot it) from close range, its going to come after you and stomp you to death.  And of course, the meat eating dinosaurs want to eat you, and all of them have excellent senses of smell, so be carefull!\n\nTo make your hunt easier, you can equip items and equipment such as camoflage, scent reducing chemicals, and a very handy radar.  Bear in mind though, that using the equipment will lower your score (you get points by killing or sedating your target dinosaurs).\n\nThe world of Carnivores is quite amazing to walk through.  Although the graphics are average at best, each world feels alive and vibrant.  Lush tropical forests, desolate deserts, jungles, beaches, ancient temples, and even a pyramid or two are some of the places you'll encounter on your journey.  Other dinosaurs such as Galamimuses walk around, looking for food and running from you when you fire or get too close.  The audio portion of the game is excelent.  Birds and insects squack and screetch in jungles, desolate and lonely wind blows across the deserts.  A lake splashes under a late afternoon sky.  A T-rex roars in the distance.  All of it adds up to a rich and imersive atmosphere.\n\nSuprisingly, Carnivores is a scary game.  Unlike games where you hunt Bambi or turkeys, the dinosaurs in the game fight back!  If a meat eater sees you, it will stop at nothing (literaly) to get to you.  If you're hunting a stegosaur, theres a good chance you might run across a velociraptor (who will immediatly come after you).  There were several moments during my playtime where I lunged out of the chair in fright!  Such as the time I had an Allosaur lined up in my crosshairs, and I was suddenly ambushed and killed by a velociraptor from behind.  Staying on your toes and remaining alert will save your life many times. And when you first hunt the T-rex?  Be prepared to be scared out of your wits.  The first time I sounded the T-rex roar, I jumped out of my seat!  (When you hear a T-rex roar, RUN!  Not that it will do you any good).\n\nOther little touches add nice depth.  If you want to leave a hunt, you have to go through a brief waiting period (\"Preparing for evacuation\"), meaning that if you're being chased by a hungry dinosaur, you cant just leave the game instantly.  You can change the amount of dinosaurs in a hunting area to suit your tastes (fancy hunting three T-rex's at once?).  There's even a feature where you can view your trophies in a hunting room.\n\nI do have a few complaints with the game though.  Hunting the meat eaters (the velociraptor and Allosaurus) is more difficult then it should be, due to the fast walking speed of the creatures.  They walk very fast, making it extremly difficult to line up a head shot (which you need to kill them), meaning that you'll die many times due to one missed shot.  This may be realistic, but it does get annoying.  There could also be some dino vs dino struggles that could take place.  Its a bit strange to see a Stegosaurus calmly eating some grass while a gigantic T-rex thunders right past it (ignoring the stegosaurus as well).  My other complaint is once you unlock all the weapons, stages, and dinosaurs, you really don't have anything else to do except just keep playing over and over again, meaning that the game can get repettitive.\n\nBut in the end, Carnivores is a suprisingly good budget game that I don't hesitate to recommend.  If you find it for under ten dollars, I'd get it.  Its a great bargin.", "summary": "Suprisingly good budget shooter", "unixReviewTime": 1104537600}

Unfortunately, the folks at Disney and Jellyvision were clearly aware of that, and the  rush was obviously on to get this game to market as soon as possible,  before the craze could die down.  The result is a game that doesn't come  close to matching either the TV show or Jellyvision's previous  efforts.\nThe most obvious problem is the limited number of questions.  This problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the game doesn't seem  to make note of which questions have already been asked--a simply  inexcusable error, which results in repeated questions after only a few  games.\nThe box proudly touts the fact that a \"virtual Regis\"  hosts the game; and sure enough, he's there.  But his involvement in the  project was clearly limited; he doesn't read any of the questions, only  providing the pre- and post-question patter.  That's understandable, given  the amount of money that Regis would have probably demanded for such a  large recording job; but it does greatly diminish the illusion of being on  the show.\nThe game's incorrect pacing destroys the rest of that illusion.  Instead of encouraging the player to take his/her time as the show does, a  30-second clock is inexplicably added.  And while the game rushes you  through the questions themselves, it needlessly slows down between them.  Since the designers couldn't have Regis read the questions, they clearly  wanted to maximize his involvement between questions; so the game stops  after every question while Regis delivers one of a set of long canned  remarks.  This is tolerable later in the game, but it comes across as  simply silly during the first few easy questions that the TV show would  blast through in short order.\nAs others have pointed out, even the  keyboard commands have problems.  Assigning a lifeline to the same key as  an answer choice is begging for mistakes; and the lack of an \"Is that  your final answer?\" question in most cases further increases the  possibility of errors, as well as erasing the remainder of the feel of  being on the show.\nThe game does have its moments; if multiple people are  playing, a clever implementation of the fastest-finger round decides who  gets to sit in the hot seat.  But frankly, I can't imagine playing this as  a multi-player game anyway; the show's format simply isn't suited to be a  party game, and this home version simply isn't exciting enough to  watch.\nIn summary, the Millionaire computer game has its (brief) moments,  but simply isn't worth even the low price Disney is asking for it.  It's  unfortunate that Disney and Jellyvision chose to put their names--and the  show's reputation--on such a disappointing effort.", "summary": "Gets neither the style nor the substance right.", "unixReviewTime": 944870400}

In some ways the difficulty of this game rivaled the NES version. I was 4 years old when Super Mario Land was introduced to me and I still pick it up every now and then on my slowly aging Gameboy Color. It was a definite must have for those long car trips (i.e. 8+ hours traveling across Montana and North Dakota in one day). Lives are fairly easy to come by with a couple per level and then at the bonus rounds at the end of the first 2 levels of each world. You can get up to 3 extra lives per bonus round. It is a short game with only 4 worlds but the length of each level helps to make up for the shortness. It has the basic power-ups: mushroom, star, fire flower (super ball instead of fireball in this version). The time limit is long enough for you to explore each level for any potential secrets but not too long that it won't challenge you to hurry to the end.\n\nThe enemies are unique. Aside from the typical goomba, you have turtles that explode when jumped on and giant Easter Island heads with tiny arms rushing at you. The Even world boss fights require a unique way to fight in that you are in a plane or a submarine and firing missiles at the boss while avoiding its attacks. Mario not jumping and throwing fireballs? Different but AWESOME! Not to mention while getting to the boss you are pushed along the side scrolling screen avoiding obstacles as enemies rush at you firing all the way. It's Galaga done sideways!\n\nSomething that doesn't always play in your favor is the gravity for Mario. He can jump high if standing in one spot and moves very far very fast when running. But when you try to run and jump he gets this \"heavy feeling\" and sometimes doesn't make it where you want him to. This \"heavy feeling\" is well noticed when he falls and it can make platform landing difficult in certain levels that are basically an open pit with floating islands. Still, I wouldn't not recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic and on-the-go game to play. It gets a 9 out of 10 in my book!", "summary": "Nostalgic.", "unixReviewTime": 1362441600}

The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.\n\nYokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game \"Donkey Kong\" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.  Yokoi came up with the Game & Watch series, \"Kid Icarus\" and \"Metroid\" for the NES, and the Gameboy.  (A \"Metroid\" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in \"Super Mario Land\").\n\nThe game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an \"Iwata Asks\" interview that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of \"Super Mario Land\".\n\nI grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros\" all the way down to \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get \"Lost Levels\" until \"Super Mario All-Stars\", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through \"Lost Levels\" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.\n\nAnyway, the two I missed? \"Super Mario Land\" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with \"Super Mario Land 2\" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and \"Super Mario Sunshine\".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.\n\nBeing the Mario fan that I am, I did play through \"Super Mario Land\" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)\n\nSo my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper \"Super Mario\" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  \"Super Mario Land\" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.\n\nDue to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of \"Metroid\".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in \"Metroid\" as well.\n\nThe game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).\n\n Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.\n\nThe loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .\n\nThe game is clearly modelled on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.\n\nThe power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.\n\nLike the other Mario titles, \"Super Mario Land\" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that \"Super Mario Land\" actually outsold the far superior \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.\n\nFor a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core \"Super Mario\" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, \"Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins\", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.\n\nMario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the \"Super Mario\" franchise.

No, I can't defend them.  Nobody can.  It's all about whether you grew up back then.  If you did, you can better understand and appreciate the way the game looks.\n\nMy biggest grip is that the play control is pretty lousy.  Mario seems to float whenever you jump, and the same can be said for many of the items such as the mushrooms that floats once removed from a coin box, and the star as well.  Oh, and the starman music is simply atrocious.  Ignore that completely.\n\nThe challenge definitely depends on how well you can control Mario's movements because if these controls were top-notch like Super Mario Bros, guess what?  Super Mario Land would be incredibly easy.  This is because a good portion of the game is basically the first Mario game blended with elements of Super Mario Bros. 3.  The only exception is the underwater fireball-spitting machine stage which is a nice shooting adventure type experiment, and the airplane stage which is basically the same thing but in the air.\n\nThe enemy animations are laughable.  The goombas look just like the mushrooms for crying out loud!  They also resemble ugly skulls, and the koopa troopas are really skinny and malnourished.  The dry fish that pop out of the ground and go directly up are mediocre looking.  Some of the other enemies that are brand new are actually reasonable.  Oh and an enemy that goes by the name of \"Bunbun\" (LOL!) is really nice.  I believe this enemy influenced the Super Mario Bros. 3 flying goombas but I could be wrong.  Actually I'm not sure I'm thinking of the right enemy after all.  Oh well, at least I got to say the hilarious word \"Bunbun!\"\n\nI just really hate how the first half of the game feels like a watered down Super Mario Bros. with the pipes and coins feeling like they're lifted directly from SMB.  Not *directly* of course, but close enough that the developers should have put in more effort to make the coins and pipes stand apart from any connection to SMB.\n\nI HATE the music.  All of it.  Just really screechy and irritating bloops and bleeps that hardly resemble a melody (except for the castle theme which is some kind of cliched Egyptian music).  There's also a fairly melodic Asian theme later on that, again, is repetitive and cliched, and the game ending music is really spectacular as well.  That's it.  At least on the NES an effort was actually made to make ALL the themes memorable and bearable.\n\nOn the plus side, I like how Mario shoots fireballs.  The way they bounce and hit enemies on an angle is a nice surprise that takes a small amount of skill to master, and the size of them is quite impressive as well.  Fighting a variety of bosses instead of Bowser is definitely a plus in my book.  Oh, and the challenge is actually pretty high in a few spots such as the bouncing boulders that you have to ride over spikes.  This is pretty hard.\n\nOh, and Daisy?  She's a LOT better than Princess Toadstool.  By now you're probably well aware that the Princess allows Bowser to kidnap her because she's an attention seeker.  Daisy is not only more attractive, but more sensible and respectable, so you really WANT to put in the additional effort to rescue her.  In a perfect world Daisy would have been the one to face an enormous amount of success and Princess Toadstool would have been forgotten.  You see Princess Toadstool is too much of a fake, generic woman who's *supposed* to be attractive like Vanna White.  Daisy is a REAL woman that you want to cuddle and comfort.  There's a BIG difference between the two.\n\nInstead of reaching a flag at the end of each stage, you're given a choice between two doors.  The top door takes you to a bonus area where you can get powerups and 1-ups.  Always go for the top door if you can.  This is mainly how you acquire 1-ups.\n\nNah it's not quite a classic but it's a commendable effort.", "summary": "good, but hardly great", "unixReviewTime": 1329177600}

While the game itself is short compared to the NES games, Mario's first SMB inspired game was still good enough to pick up and play.\n\nSuper Mario Land took the same game play mechanics of Super Mario Bros for the NES, added a few familiar enemies while bringing in new ones, changed some power ups and introduced a new princess to rescue. As Mario, you stomp on enemies, collect power ups and coins through 4 worlds each with 4 levels. To switch things up, you control an airplane and a submarine on a few stages and this time Bowser isn't the main villain you're after.\n\nThe PROS: It was a dream come true for many Game Boy owners: the chance to play a portable Mario game and it was good too. For its time, the graphics and sounds were what you expected in a Mario game while the music was in a class all its own. The fact that it was similar to Super Mario Bros yet it had its own feel was different and that was a good thing.\n\nThe CONS: While the game was good, you can't help to think that just when you were getting into the game, it's over. It was because it was super short compared to Super Mario Bros.

In this game you are not in the Mushroom kingdom or the dream world of Subcon, instead you are in a weird place called Sarasaland where a new princess named Daisy was kidnapped by an alien named Tatanga. Here in this game you do 12 levels in 4 worlds as you fight goombas, Koopas with bombs instead of shells, Chinese ghosts, Moai statue heads that attack and more bizarre stuff.\n\nIt's a fresh and different Mario adventure just like the last year's Super Mario Bros. 2 game only more true to the original Super Mario Bros. formula of the first game. What's cool in this game you get a special flower that grants you a special ball that defeats enemies and collects coins for you, there's also different enemies to fight such as killer Sphinxes to giant Sea-Horses as in 2 levels it can become a sidescroller where your in a Sub or plane blasting enemies including bosses which makes this a worthwhile Mario game.\n\nThe graphics are simplistic yet primitive and small for the gameboy but works well on Super GameBoy for the SNES.

The first-ever Mario platformer on a handheld, it is a faithful-yet-quirky game that's a trip down memory lane.\n\nWhile video games at home were getting much more sophisticated by 1989, handhelds were still in its infancy. Mario had already been a household name by then thanks to Super Mario Bros. on the NES, and Mario was exactly what the budding Game Boy needed to succeed.\n\nFamiliar characters and gameplay welcome the player without much of a learning curve, but there are some distinct differences. While the NES counterpart had castles as their main theme, Mario this time around travels to Egypt, China, and even another planet. Goombas and Piranha Plants make a comeback along with the upgraded Koopa Troopas, who now explode upon getting stepped on. Other enemies include aliens, sphinxes, and Chinese ghosts. There are also a couple side-scrolling shooter type levels that keep the game interesting.\n\nThe music was memorable and catchy, very fitting for the levels. The ending theme is also nice, but it doesn't feel very \"Mario.\" I also didn't feel that the game ended on a positive note, as the last level was a side-scrolling shooter -- not a very \"Mario\" way to wrap up a game. As with most Mario games at this era, the story is transparent as usual. The level designs are still creative and fun to play, but game is short with only 4 worlds with 4 levels each -- it's to be expected since there's no saving feature (run out of AA batteries and you're starting over). Also not so surprising is the lack of a 2-player option.\n\nSuper Mario Land definitely shows its age, but it's still a very fun game to play. It may only take you one sitting to beat, but the current cheap prices for the game should merit a purchase for the Mario fan.", "summary": "A great start for Game Boy", "unixReviewTime": 1190764800}

There are four levels to beat, and each end of the level has a boss to beat.\n\nThe super powers are origonal. All you get is the mushroom and the fire flower. And when you get hit, you'll turn back small (not Super Mario like most games). Also some of the enemies are very difficult to beat and takes a while to kill. And at times, some levels are too difficult to beat (Like the third level [Easter Island]), so it gets real fustrating.

A fighting game with a story, who knew. The story is: A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world. These seven gods are giant dinosaurs and apes which is pretty cool. Now, as one of these crazy blood thirsty monsters, you are set out to conquer the Earth. The story is pretty good in my opinion.\n\nGameplay: This fighting game is unlike any other fighting game you'll ever play. I say that because you get to fight as dinosaurs and giant apes, how cool is that ? In this game you play as one of seven dinossaurs/apes (five dinosaurs and 2 apes to be exact). You can either play as Diablo, a hellish looking T-rex, Blizzard, a cold blooded killer ape, Sauron, a crazy telepathic T-rex, Talon, a crazy fast and deadly raptor, Vertigo, the poisonous long necked dino, Chaos, a crazy King kong like ape, and Armadon, a vicious crazy triceratops. Well, just like any other fighting game you got your basic moves like you got your high and low attacks. But, instead of punching and kicking like humans do, in Primal Rage you get to tail whip, bite, slash with your claws, and kick slash with your claws too. Mixing some of those moves up add up to some deadly combos. If you do these fast enough you can make your enemy brain dead for a couple of seconds which means they can't move and it's your chance to get more attacks on your opponent which is very helpful. Each character has there own special moves like Blizzard has his Ice breath attack, and Chaos with his weird fart bubble attack which is weird but cool, Sauron has his telekinetic force field, Diablo has his fireball attack which is pretty rad and those are just some of the cool special moves you can pull off. After you have beaten your opponent in two rounds, you can choose to humilliate them by performing a finishing move on them. (like a fatality on mortal kombat). For example, Sauron's Crusher, he just jumps really high in the air and then he just stomps on corpse and turns it into mushy guts. It's a pretty awesome finishing move. Primal Rage has a 2-player versus mode which is pretty fun to whoop your friends at.\n\nGraphics: The graphics look great with it's awesome looking levels like Diablo's level that has the raging volcano is nice to look at as is Armadon's cave level which looks too cool. The dinosaurs/apes themselves just look fantastic. Blood spraying out of your opponent and yourself is just plain brutal and awesome to look at as is watching your opponents heart explode when you just beaten him.\n\nSound: The music in the game is interesting with its tribal tunes. The roar and yelps of the dinos/apes sound outstanding.\n\nReplay Value: This is one of those fighters that you come back to in like a week or so. The 2-player versus mode well definetly bring you back as well as the single player.

I ordered three or 4 each from the separate, available vendors and all arrived well in time. All are excellent.\n\nI first learned of these Wario Land Games by spending many months learning, on my own, through the Wario Land 4 cartridges that I bought as people traded them in at Video Game stores. When the kids were getting older and ready for more aggressive fare, I suppose.  I loved buying them and seeing how far along the original owner had - had not - gotten.  I bought  a bunch of them while they were still available as I realized that it would only be a matter of time before the newer and newer games and consoles would cause these to not only become unavailable, but possibly unappreciated for the wonderful things they are.\nNot one of these former owners ever even had a clue that in addition to the \"normal\" version and the \"hard\" version, there is a Super Hard Version.  The amount of skills it takes to complete correctly the series in order to continue....are not written down anywhere that I could find.  There are helps on the Internet, but these people make assumptions that all gamers talk to each other and therefore\nlearn what they need to know that no one can perhaps figure out. They leave out a lot.  I (at 75) had to figure them out for myself.  My wonderful childhood was wholesome and much less fast-paced...safer for playing out of doors, for example.....having an hour to walk home, eat lunch and walk back to school...today this is unheard of.\nBut these games are an excellent preparation for today's hurried world.  The amount of coordination needed is tremendous.  I have learned not only this coordination, but patience (sometimes you must do something over and over and over and over), perseverance (and over and over more times yet) to get your timing right - discipline, and creative concepts that require to think like a kid!\n\nOnly then did I go back to try the Wario Land II and Wario Land 3 games.  Oh, my heavens!\nThe Wario Land 4 really seemed easy by comparison.  Every technique that I had to teach myself to master in that set of games was originated in II and 3.  The characters are different and the stories different but I would have been lost without doing Wario Land 4 first.  It at least gave me a chance.\nThe difference between II and 3 is that in II Wario has all his skills available.  It becomes impossible, just at the very last game, at least for me.\nMost important is that none of these games kills off the character.  You get to try and try and try until you succeed or throw the thing at a bed or a chair!  Then you try some more.  I don't know about it developing one's character, but all of the above disciplines do indeed get improved.\nAnd I bought two cartridges of the original and two cartridges of the later developed more up-dated cartridges of the Wario Land II..\nThe Wario Land II progresses logically.  The Wario Land 3 is maddening.  If it had not been for Penaldan (German?) I would never have EVER been able to progress anywhere!  Without achieving a certain treasure within a certain territory, you can not proceed to any other territory!\nYou do not proceed in an expected typical order, but must achieve certain things at different locations.\nBlaziken 257 - turns out to be the name of a previous game's  fiery Pokmon character.  So I am thinking that the company put out these You Tube videos.\nI have written down the order for the 101 Episodes.  Without this \"bible\" there is no way to know how to proceed to succeed in the entire sequence.  And I do not understand how one person could so flawlessly execute these for us as examples.  I am a well-coordinated person.  It took me free time as I found it (a lot!) for over two days, for example, to master the  one skill to achieve what seemed impossible.  And this has occurred repeatedly, for each new skill to be accomplished.\n\nThe Game Boy little compacts fit in a pocket, they hold  charge for hours and they are exquisite.\nI pocket one whenever we go anywhere \"just in case\" there might be a few minutes to play and then store the progress until another convenient time.  In our lives we are playing in four community bands, teaching private lessons, working on our Victorian house and a few other things.  We eat out a lot.\nLife is grand.  just because these did not exist when we were kids, does not mean that we can not enjoy them.  I feel sorry for the fuddy-duddies who look on at me with disgust - well...actually, just one person - who thinks that I am wasting my time!  If so, it is mine to waste.  If you live as long as I have, you know what car repairs cost, what food costs, where things are heading in this country and in the world.  It is lovely to just stop time for a while, and play a Wario Land game where the character never dies!\nnancy morse", "summary": "Wario Land II  Game Boy Advance SP", "unixReviewTime": 1379030400}

The original's gameplay was a hugely modified from Super Mario Land 2 to replace Mario's block-hitting and Goomba-stomping with enemy bashing, Ground Pounding, and crazy powers that help improve your regular bashing attack. This game may not have those power-ups, nor does it have any evidence of Mario Land 2, but it surely took all of the great original elements of the first Wario Land and made it 5 times better.\n\nThe graphics look amazing on the old-school Game Boy, and the sound effects/music are just as spot-on. You would think that by then, since the Nintendo 64 and Playstation systems were out (Oh, and Saturn), the monochrome graphics and sounds would be weak by the years' standards, but nope (And the Game Boy Color version has....color!).\n\nOne unique aspect about Wario Land 2 is that you can't lose/gain lives, so it wouldn't be a frustrating experience for new players. However, there's no need to worry about the difficulty, as the challenge is still there, and going strong enough to be fair for everyone.\n\nThe level designs have a very interesting variety of platforms and enemies, as well as some neat decorations. The game never seems to grow pretty boring at all. And along with all of the bashing, throwing, pouncing, etc you could do, there are also a few puzzle elements thrown in certain levels /:-)\n\nOverall, this is an amazing Game Boy experience, and like all the Nintendo greats out there, it remains timeless to this day.", "summary": "Yet another Nintendo classic :-)", "unixReviewTime": 1323302400}

I found this game also a very long time ago at an old video rental store and figured to give it a shot. I knew it wasn't based on the arcade game; so instead I was really impressed and surprised.\n\nIt turned out to be a very challenging yet entertaining game. When you start the game you begin in the frozen Siberia; no press start, options, select your character, it really began just like you were flipping through the pages of a comic book. Also as the game progresses you have the option of choosing between different x-men such as Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Gambit, Psylock, and Beast! Later you can even use Magneto but you have to beat him first; he's a boss character you can use, now that was another original idea of this game that made it great. Each character has very unique abilities; so as you progress through the game you will find some are much better than others at getting through levels. Another interesting thing about using the different characters each one makes the game feel different. Playing as Gambit it feels like your playing an adventure side-scroller like Strider or Castlevania. Playing as Beast kinda gives it a feel like an incredible hulk game, Magneto feels like your playing Vector Man for those who know about that classic game also for the Genesis.\n\nThis is a game with re-playability and also has excellent music and very colorful graphics.

Your characters move much quicker, your mutant powers are unlimited, the graphics are a little better, and the difficulty is fair with the gameplay.  This game definitley stood the test of time and is also better than Mutant Apocalypse for Super NES. You go through several levels fighting your way through armed ninjas, Acolyte soldiers, pre-historic reptiles, savage land mutants, phalanx robots and clones and the difficulty rises as you move on, so if you made it that far, you've been  dared to face pure torture so plan wisely. Whatever you do, do not use a 2 player co-op unless your partner is as skilled and as fast paced as you because not only the overall gameplay slows down, but getting ahead will be difficult if he/she sucks.  Like the previous game, the many obsticles you must face is not designed for a two player co-op.  This isn't Ninja Turtles or Contra, so you can't mess up if you dare to use the 2 player co-op.\n\nYou have the original lineup: Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Gambit.  Gambit and Cyclops' mutant powers are weak and so are their jumping, but their speed is up to par.  Wolverine and Nightcrawler stand out from all the characters because they can climb and crawl on walls and ceilings, can jump high, and are the quickest characters, not to mention Wolverine's strong mutant attack and healing factor (if you wait a few minutes when your health is running low). There are three new mutants in the roster.  Psylocke has the highest jump, best ranged attack, and strongest mutant power attack(unfortunatley robots are immune to her psychic knife).  Beast's regular attacks and mutant attacks are the strongest, but his speed is not up to par.  Both Psylocke and Beast can stick onto walls, but can't crawl like Wolverine and Nightcrawler.  As for Magneto, if you think it is easy street to finally control one of the most powerful mutants in the world, think again.  To balance out the rest of the characters, Magneto was designed to be the slowest character in the game of which he has only two weak attacks (projectles only), but he can float on command.  As I recall, he's only useful for one level (which is the Apocalypse level for obvious reasons).\n\nThis game is worth adding to your genesis collection and so far one of the best Marvel Comics licensed games for a 16-bit system.

However, I played a couple of the NES games.\n\nBatman Forever was based off of a movie, but the game is actually fairly good. Unfortunately, there are flaws.\n\nAs soon as you start playing the game, you'll realize that it is kind of a rebuilt Mortal Kombat. It has the same control scheme and the game is even made by Acclaim. It you like Mortal Kombat games, then this might be good news for you. Although it shares the controls with Mortal Kombat, there are, of course, new additions, such as the grappling hook and the Batarang. The grappling hook might take some getting used to.\n\nWhat has me dock a star off this review is that the challenge feels cheap at times. There is a way or two how more than half your health will drain from an enemy using their attack (Not the standard fighting moves). Everything else is great.\n\nIf you are playing with a 3-button controller, you must press B and C (at the same time) + Up to shoot up. If you press all buttons at the same time, you just jump. And as for jumping down a hole, you must press C + Down. If you're using a 6-button controller, then you just need to use the Y button for the grappling hook instead of B and C. At least it isn't as terrible how the Super Nintendo version had it (Select + Up...Down + R)\n\nThe graphics are really amazing for a Genesis game. Digitizing the actors...just like Mortal Kombat. The backgrounds are also dark and stylish. To think that Batman Forever would've actually made itself at home on the Sega 32x.\n\nThe sound effects are also pretty cool, although you'd hear smacks and punches most of the time. And sometimes, you might not understand what the voice is saying when you collect a riddle (We could blame Genesis hardware for that, maybe).\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of this game is the fact that there isn't a save feature. Now, there are video games in which you don't even need to save your game. But here, it's pretty lengthy. Plus, the game gets kinda hard at times.\n\nWhat's really awesome about this game is how you can play with another player in a co-op mode (Co-op Mortal Kombat, eh?). However, that might make the game kinda harder.\n\nThere's also a Training mode. This mode has you beat up enemies until you die. Just keep progressing through difficulty levels, beating up punks. You can play as any character you want here. Even all the enemies (Pick the guy with the flamethrower) and Two-Face. This could just be a Genesis game itself, considering how some popular Genesis games don't have this mode. You can also play with a friend HERE, which is where things get really fun.\n\nAlso in Training Mode, you can battle your friend.

Nobody thought anybody could top the \"Big N\" (Nintendo), but thanks to a game called \"Mortal Kombat\", the Genesis was suddenly wanted more than Nintendo's SNES. See, the reason is that Nintendo's \"game quality policy\" (I call it censorship) prohibited images like blood and graphic violence (read \"Sub-Zero ripping out Johnny Cage's spine\"), so MK on the SNES was censored (instead of blood, there was sweat, and the fatalities were toned down to the point they resembled the \"Friendship\" moves from MK2). Well, on the Genesis, thanks to the \"DULLARD\" code (hit down, up, left, left, A, right, down at the title screen of the Genesis version) you could play MK with the blood and real fatalities. However, there was more to Genesis than Mortal Kombat. Sonic The Hedgehog 1 and Sonic 2 are two of my most favorite titles.

Simply because I felt that regardless of the lack of color or high-tech gadgets that many systems had nowadays, my trusty Game Boy Pocket was still \"fun\". In fact, I hear the new Nintendo DS has no Game Boy functionality - only a Game Boy Advance port (which I own not). That's another reason why I may not get that particular system.\n\nThe Game Boy Pocket is small. It's very small. Yet, this does not detract from the functionality. Another plus is that this system has a CONTRAST SLIDER -- unlike the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, you can alter the brightness or darkness of the screen -- perfect for when you're trying to see something that's just too bright to see (fans of the Pokemon series will remember the Fuchsia City Gym's infamous invisible walls, for example). The contrast slider and its black and white (not green and white like that of the Game Boy) screen alone warranted a buy for me back in the day.\n\nI admit that now, many people believe the Game Boy Pocket seems to be obsolete. That's absurd. Those who wish to save money can get one and still have fun. Those who wish to put in a bit more can have the Game Boy Color (which unfortunately I still do not own, but realize the fun of).

It's not too entertaining, and it gets really boring after a few hours, you'll just want to leave it lying on your unused video game pile for a while before breaking it out again after a few months. Other then that, it's a good game, although not fit for me that much, more for the hardcore wrestling fan that doesn't really care about the quality...still a classic worth paying for, although it vaguely reminds me of a WWE Plug and Play game I have, and I bought it for around ten dollars, I got this for a cheaper price. =)\nGenesis owners and wrestling fans, rejoice!\nI'm more of a new generation wrestling video game fan and a beat em up fan, so don't take my opinion too much into consideration, try looking at the other reviews first, and look at them as a whole. >Sort of biased<", "summary": "A Classic", "unixReviewTime": 1248393600}

I had to buy it again because some douchebags stole my games at my house. I bought it again after I bought the Playstation game because it loads too much at the challenge match at the last match. The Sega Genesis one is better because it has a short load time,but the wrestlers are a little smaller, hardly noticeable it looks  close to the arcade version. I use to play this game a lot after school. It has eight wrestlers:Razor Ramon,Bret Hart,Yokozuna,The Undertaker, Bam Bam Bigelow,Doink the clown,Shawn Michaels, and Lex Luger. My favorite wrestler is Razor Ramon(Scott Hall)because he has effective moves plus he is my favorite in real life. I wish Midway would make another one it with 30 wrestlers and still keep it 2d, but have it really detailed it would be so much fun online and two player co-op mode. I would recommend this game if you like 2d fighters and like Midway style of over the top fighting.\n\nPros: great choice of wrestlers, Mortal Kombat-style fighting, hours of fun, looked better than other wrestling games at the time, a lot of moves for each wrestler, not as cheap as MK, find out different combos, digitized graphics make wrestlers look real, 2 player co-op mode\n\nCons: digitized graphics don't look as good by today's standard, too short only has 8 wrestlers", "summary": "wrestling game with over the top fighting", "unixReviewTime": 1218326400}

A \"Super Sonic Spin Dash\" has also been added, which allows you to rev up in place to gain speed to climb those pesky slopes, or beat your friend Tails in a race. Oh yeah, there's multiplayer!

Splitscreen race to the finish between Sonic and Tails! All in all, most players will probably feel the need to hunt down Dr. Ivo Robotnik and defeat him once again.

It fixes the flaws in Sonic The Hedgehog 1.\n\nPlot\n\nAfter defeating Dr. Robotnik in the last game, Robotnik gets back to work with his usual scheme of taking over the world. Like in the last game, he's captured a bunch of animals and is turning them into malicious robots, and is building a devastation space weapon called the Death Egg. You take control of Sonic again to thwart Robotnik's plans, and this time, a two-tailed fox by the name of Tails Prower tags along and helps you.\n\nIf you're familiar with the way Sonic 1 plays, then you know how to complete this game. However, they added a critical improvement in Sonic 2, which is the spindash. All you do is crouch down (By holding the bottom d-pad) and hit the jump button to start spinning, and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash. With the spindash, you can also plow into most Badniks and they'll get destroyed.\n\nAll the power ups like the Ring monitor, Invincibility monitor, Shield monitor, and Extra Life monitor are in this game.\n\nThere's also a point to getting Chaos Emeralds. If you collect all the Chaos Emeralds (now its seven emeralds instead of six) and get 50 rings, you turn into Super Sonic. Super Sonic is a yellow juggernaut. Other than drowning, bottomless pits, and getting crushed, nothing can hurt Super Sonic, as he's not only invincible, but he can run extremely fast and jump over really long distances. The only drawback to Super Sonic is that your ring count gets deducted at one ring per second, and once you run out of rings, you turn back into regular Sonic.\n\nThe Special Stage is different from that in Sonic 1. Instead of collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act, you collect 50 rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post. You also race through a half-pipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint. When you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings, you get a Chaos Emerald.\n\nYou also have the option to switch between Sonic & Tails, Sonic solo, and Tails solo when playing the one-player mode.\n\nThere's also a 2-player mode for this game. Basically, it's a split-screen racing game where you and a second player choose as Sonic or Tails and race each other until the end of the acts. The acts to choose from in the 2-Player mode are Emerald Hill, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, and the Special Stage.\n\nThe soundtrack is even better than that in the first game. Aside from having more levels and therefore more music tracks, a good deal of the music on here is better than in the first game. Standout tracks on here are for Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, Metropolis, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg. Death Egg is the perfect music to hear when you're in a high-tech spacecraft. Mystic Cave is worth mentioning because the opening melody is really reminiscent of the Inspector Gadget theme, and that the music itself is pretty creepy. Casino Night and Sky Chase have really relaxed, upbeat feelings to them.\n\nThe 2-player levels even have their own versions of the music.\n\nOf all the \"classic\" Sonic games and with the entire Sonic game library, this one fixes the flaws of the first game It's been re-issued countless times and is available with other Sonic games like Sonic's Mega Collection etc and available as individual game downloads on Steam.\n\nBoss\n\nBoss battles are just as good but when you go to the death egg u encounter silver sonic a robotic looking sonic prototype\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 2\nstory 10/10\ncontrol 10/10\nMusic 10/10\ngraphics 10/10\nBoss battles 10/10\nmy final thoughts Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is a great sequel and I hope Sonic's third game is just as great as many other Sonic games", "summary": "Sonic The Hedgehog 2", "unixReviewTime": 1350345600}

I still prefer Green Hill Zone or Angel Island to this level, but it is a good design. The theme was rather weak, and THE FIGHT WITH EGGMAN WAS THE FUNNIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE. He swoops down and gets in a bulldozer and tries to run over Sonic. It only took 5 seconds for the tires to pop off while Eggman tried to retreat. I guess Emerald Hill was okay, but I've seen better.\n\nChemical plant- 10/10: Sonic had a ton of speed in Chemical Plant. If this were a Mario level you would never complete it in time. The level is so massive, but Sonic made it look like a trip to the local market. The theme is one of the most catchy things ever produced as well, but the boss was a another LOL moment. Eggman spends half an hour filling up a tiny bucket with chemicals, and then tries to dump it on Sonic. Poor Eggman's Eggpod exploded before he could even finish filling up the bucket.\n\nAquatic Ruins- 2/10: Aquatic Ruins was the first bad zone in Sonic 2. I never said that every zone was great. The main issue with Auqatic Ruins was it's distorting and glitchy layers. Plants blocked my view, the scrolling was funky, and I could never really tell what I was doing. The boss ended up being better then the other two, but Eggman was a little too difficult.\n\nCasino Night- 9/10: The colorful graphics, giant slot machines, and jazzy theme really gave Casino Night a lot of charm. Even Eggman decorated his Eggpod with a ton of flashing lights. Casino Night is definetly one of my top 5 favorite zones in Sonic.\n\nHill Top- 5/10: Hill Top did not impress me very much. It felt like a remade Marble Zone, and that feeling was only heightened when the Eggman fight was the same thing as the Marble Zone.\n\nMystic Cave- 7/10: This level focused more on puzzle then speed. Unlocking rock doors got really frustrating. I've seen Sega have better ideas then a cave, but it was not that bad.\n\nOil Ocean- 8/10: The first Sonic level with a sadder tone to it. Every other zone was boosting with peppy music and bright colors, even in a chemical factory. Oil Ocean had a orange background that showed a shaky sun. The entire level's bottom part was covered in oil. Oil Ocean is one of my favorites because of the sadder pace, though.\n\nMetropolis Zone- 0/10: I HATE THIS ZONE SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's dumb factory theme dosen't fit it's name, the musical score is out of tune, and IT IS EXTREMLY DIFFICULT, AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH SEGA MADE IT 3 ACTS INSTEAD OF 2! All of my friends agreed with me, Metropolis zone is awful.\n\nSky Chase- 8/10: Many people did not like this zone. I thought it was a nice change of pace, though. Sonic gets in his airplane and chases Eggman's Flying Fortress. That was pretty much it. I liked it.\n\nWing Fortress- 7/10: Eggman's base is a unique level. The theme was a very peppy bugel theme, and the design of the level was very good. After Wing Fortress it came time for the final level!\n\nDeath Egg-  6/10: Not so much a level as it was an area for the final boss. The Death Egg in Sonic 3 and Knuckles was really amazing full zone, but the Sonic 2 Death Egg only had 2 bosses. Metal Sonic looked strange and no rings made it hard. The Final Boss was another LOL moment, but not because it was too easy. Eggman built a HUGE overweight Eggman robot that looked just like him. One of the reasons Eggman is my favorite video game villan is because of his ego. After defeating Eggman's Eggman Robo, the ending plays. A beautiful 3D ending that was really worth the playthrough. The End. Sonic 2 is awesome. No Genesis will ever be complete without Sonic 2.", "summary": "Pure classic", "unixReviewTime": 1341014400}

I believe my first encounter with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was at the nearest Wal-Mart back in the late summer/early fall of 1992 and I remember seeing the game on display in the videogame section, and I played the Emerald Hill Zone, and I couldn't wait for the game to come out.  Fast forward several months later, and it's Christmas Day, and I got Sonic 2.  I spent most of the day playing this and even back then, I felt it was better than the first game (which is still a classic).  Over the years, I've given some deeper thought about which of the classic Sonic games is the best, I think Sonic 2 is the best of all because it retains a good challenge and fixes the flaws in Sonic 1.\n\nSTORY\n\nAfter defeating Dr. Robotnik in the last game, Robotnik gets back to work with his usual scheme of taking over the world.  Like in the last game, he's captured a bunch of animals and is turning them into malicious robots, and is building a devastation space weapon called the Death Egg.  You take control of Sonic again to thwart Robotnik's plans, and this time, a two-tailed fox by the name of Miles \"Tails\" Prower tags along and helps you.\n\nGAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nIf you're familiar with the way Sonic 1 plays, then you know how to complete 99% of the controls in this game.  However, they added a critical improvement in Sonic 2, which is the spindash attack.  All you do is crouch down (holding the bottom d-pad) and hit the jump button to start spinning, and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash.  With the spindash, you can also plow into most Badniks and they'll get destroyed.\n\nAll the power ups like the Ring monitor, Invincibility monitor, Shield monitor, and Extra Life monitor are in this game.  The rules about collecting rings in Sonic 1 carry over into Sonic 2.\n\nAlso, there's a point in getting points this time around.  At the end of each act, if you get 10,000 points in that act, you'll get a continue.  Whenever your cumulative score hits 50,000 and numbers with a divisor of 50,000 (such as 100,000 and 150,000), you get an extra life.\n\nThere's also a point to getting Chaos Emeralds.  If you collect all the Chaos Emeralds (now its seven emeralds instead of six) and get 50 rings, you turn into Super Sonic.  Super Sonic is a yellow juggernaut.  Other than drowning, bottomless pits, and getting crushed, nothing can hurt Super Sonic, as he's not only invincible, but he can run extremely fast and jump over really long distances.  The only drawback to Super Sonic is that your ring count gets deducted at one ring per second, and once you run out of rings, you turn back into regular Sonic.\n\nThe Special Stage is different from that in Sonic 1.  Instead of collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act, you collect 50 rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post.  You also race through a half-pipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint.  When you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings, you get a Chaos Emerald.  These Special Stages are significantly more difficult than the ones in Sonic 1 because aside from needed to collect the required rings, you have to dodge a bunch of bombs, and these can be hard to dodge.  It also doesn't help that usually, Tails will get hit by bombs, making you loose some of your rings.\n\nYou also have the option to switch between Sonic + Tails, Sonic solo, and Tails solo when playing the one-player mode.\n\n2-PLAYER MODE\n\nThere's also a 2-player mode for this game.  Basically, it's a split-screen racing game where you and a second player choose as Sonic or Tails and race each other until the end of the acts.  The acts to choose from in the 2-Player mode are Emerald Hill, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, and the Special Stage.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nWhile the graphics in Sonic 1 are impressive, Sonic 2 manages to improve upon this area as well.  There's better color arrangements to improve visual depth on the levels and backgrounds.  The finest example of this would be the Casino Night Zone.  The background in that level is absolutely beautiful and colorful, and makes you feel like you're in a \"sanitized\" version of Las Vegas.  The \"industrial\" themed levels like the Chemical Plant, Oil Ocean, Metropolis, and Death Egg Zones have improved from industrial-themed levels in Sonic 1 as well.  The architecture and atmospheres in these levels are much more serious-looking than in Sonic 1, and particularly with the Chemical Plant and Death Egg Zones, I think they perfectly exemplify the way a high-tech, industrial setting should look like.\n\nSOUND/SOUNDTRACK\n\nAll the sound effects from the first game are carried over into this one, so I can't really say much more than what I already said in my Sonic 1 review.\n\nThe soundtrack is even better than that in the first game, and Masato Nakamura returns to create music in this game as well.  Aside from having more levels and therefore more music tracks, a good deal of the music on here is better than in the first game (which still has great music).  Standout tracks on here are for Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, Metropolis, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg (though for Death Egg, you only hear about four seconds of the music since you immediately go into one of the last boss battles).  Death Egg is the perfect music to hear when you're in a high-tech spacecraft.  Mystic Cave is worth mentioning because the opening melody is really reminiscent of the Inspector Gadget theme, and that the music itself is pretty creepy.  Casino Night and Sky Chase have really relaxed, upbeat feelings to them.\n\nThe 2-player levels even have their own versions of the music.  The 2-player version of Casino Night has a peppier beat to it, and reminds me a bit of the Last Resort club music featured in Total Recall.  I personally think the 2-player version of the Emerald Hill Zone sounds better than the single player version.\n\nThere's also a track called Hidden Palace for an unreleased level of the same name in the game.  Despite not being in any levels, I think this is one of the most elegant videogame tunes I've ever heard.\n\nMINOR COMPLAINTS\n\nMy only real complaint with this game is that in the Special Stage, Tails can make it more difficult for the fact that he's prone to getting hit by bombs, so you have to be extra careful with how you play in the stages.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nOf all the \"classic\" Sonic games and with the entire Sonic game library, this one is the best.

Because of the game's success, Gameboy allowed Konami to make a sequel with a bigger challenge and more levels/bosses (TMNT II: Back From The Sewers).

Well, it just so happened to lead to lots of other games in the series, like the NES TMNT, Turtles in Time, Tournament Fighters, etc. Well, Around those times, Konami created a Game Boy TMNT game. At first, I had no idea what the heck it would be like. Would it be a platformer like the first NES game? And then it was released.....and blew us off with awesomism.\n\nFall of the Foot Clan is a beat 'em up, similar to the arcade games, but with the look of a sidescroller. The action is much more atraightfoward and simpler compared to other games (Most enemies die in one hit), but it's also very well-polished. The graphics and music are extremely appealing to the eye/ear. In fact, some tunes sound like they could be right at home on the Sega Genesis. Konami really knew how to rock out that Game Boy sound chip!\n\nThe game may be short, as it has 5 stages (And for some reason, it has a stage select, meaning you can just go to Stage 5 to beat the game), and it may have the Turtles put on an awkward smile throughout the game, but all in all, Fall of the Foot Clan is an epic classic!", "summary": "Another epic classic!", "unixReviewTime": 1324944000}

Each of the turtles are playable and all of their major enemies have been included. Increasing your life meter can be done by grabbing the turtles' favorite food, pizza. Gameplay is better than average. Each turtle has their appropriate weapon. Every weapon has the same power so the longer weapons of Leonardo and Donatello are the most useful. One button is used for attack and the other for jumping. Jumping seems a bit tight, meaning you can't get too far on a jump. Jumps are best used to go straight up to avoid enemies or making a hop on to the next step up. One other attack is done by crouching and pressing the attack button. This will throw a shuriken. Levels are broken down into stages. When you lose a turtle on a level and have others left you will be brought back to the beginning of the stage you were last on. No continues are offered so you will have to make it through without losing all 4 turtles. Before each level or when a turtle goes down you have the option of selecting another. It is probably best to begin the game with either Raphael or Michaelangelo so you can have the guys with longer weapons for the more difficult levels.\nMany small enemies have been created for the game. Your majority of attackers though are from the television series and comic books. Those would be the Foot Soldiers and the Mousers. Most can be defeated with one hit so the challenge should not be too difficult. The whole game takes place while you progress to the right. Graphics look really good. Level backgrounds are detailed enough to give you an impression of where you are. Characters all look like themselves. The turtles can only be identified form each other by their weapons. Sounds are okay but all of your attacks sound the same. You can't hear a difference between a katana blade and a bo staff. If you are a fan of the turtles then Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan should not disappoint you. For those who don't care for the turtles then this game doesn't offer anyhting you can't find somewhere else.

Sure, there are only four small stages for 2-player, but those four stages pack a real fun punch. The new special stages are also funner than the special stages in Sonic 2's prequel. Although Tails can't exactly use his ability of flight, it's still pretty fun if you play with a friend, because Tails can really help Sonic. He can make the boss fights easier, he can kill badniks before Sonic can devastatingly crash into them, and he can also collect those rings that Sonic doesn't want to get because he doesn't want to destroy his ring total. This game is purely amazing, and I think it's more of a classic than the first in the series, the one and only Sonic the Hedgehog.

There are nicely detailed sprites and environments, or as nice as they can be on the Gameboy. At the start of each level you can pick which turtle you want to play as. This doesn't really change much outside of what weapon they hold and unfortunately, due to their size, the game moves somewhat slowly. The music is really good and gives the same kind of mood you might feel playing one of the console Ninja Turtles games.

The second Genesis Sonic game.\n\nOnce Sega established themselves as a worthy contender of the 16-bit era with the original Sonic The Hedgehog, they knew their newly successful mascot shouldn't be relegated to a \"one-game-wonder\" status, so they set out to follow it up with a sequel in order to keep the public's attention on them. Although Sonic was the true origin of the 16-bit wars between the giants Sega and Nintendo, this time Sega had a much greater challenge ahead of them. By 1992, the big N had just released their new SNES system along with a slew of outstanding games. Therefore Sega had to react fast. Sonic fast. They had to figure out how to draw people back to the ring collecting, speed shoes, chaos emeralds, and blue hedgehogs in a time when people were absorbed with Yoshis, Simon Belmonts, F-Zeros, and Street Fighters. Sega started work first on what would later become Sonic CD (for the Sega CD), but put it away briefly and made some other graphical upgrades to have a game ready for 1992. What resulted is Sonic 2. Did it live up to the original, or did the game fall under the inferior sequel curse? I'm sure you already know my answer...\n\nThis my friends, is a true classic. Sonic 2 not only puts to rest any worries one would've had with a Sonic sequel, but it improved greatly upon the original game as well! I'd have to say that this is probably the single best and most well-designed Sonic game ever made (although Sonic CD is still my personal favorite, and hooking Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles together truly makes the best sonic game). Sonic 1 had awesome level structures, cool music, and fun gameplay, but its sequel takes those aspects to the next level of greatness. In addition to what's already established, this game adds great things like the Speed Dash, Tails/Miles the fox, chemical plants, 2 player competition modes, the 7th chaos emerald, the Death Egg ship, corkscrew tunnels, oil oceans, speedy bonus stages, coconut throwing monkeys, the starpost, and Super Sonic. Take a look at all the stuff that makes this game great and the (very) few small quibbles that it falls short:\n\nPROS\n-EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGNS. Sonic's main gimmick was that he's fast, right? Well Sega wisely chose to center the level structures this time around his speedy characteristics and as a result, the levels are extremely fun to go through. There's still plenty of platforming action amidst the flurry of speed, so the challenge is ever present. The Zones are extremely varied as well, so you'll never get bored with the levels.\n-ENTER TAILS THE FOX. Joining Sonic's (then) latest adventure is this small orange fox who sports 2 tails allowing him to fly. In single player mode, he accompanies you in collecting rings and rescuing you from the clutches of robots. Another person can control him as well.\n-AWESOME 2 PLAYER MODE! This mode is really fun because it pits two people against each other going through one of 4 zones from the game. There's some cool powerups that make things extra difficult for the other player.\n-THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK HERE IS SOME OF THE BEST IN VIDEOGAME MUSIC. Seriously. This ranks up there with Mega Man 2, Gradius 2 & 3, Castlevania 4 & SotN, and Turrican as far as jaw-dropping video game music goes. Not a single one of these tunes is bad, and all are very catchy, probably some of the best that you'll find on the Genesis. My favorites have to be the Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, (2-player) Mystic Cave, and Metropolis tunes.\n-MUCH BETTER SPECIAL STAGES. This time around, you're put in a 3D-ish tunnel in which you have to collect a certain amount of rings and avoid the spike traps. It's still very challenging like the first game's stages are, but thankfully it eliminates the frustration by offering you A LOT MORE chances to tackle them throughout the game.\n-EVEN BETTER ASSORTMENT OF ENEMIES THIS TIME. There are a lot of cool enemies you'll face like the aformentioned monkeys with coconuts, armored crabs, lava dragons, claw mantis, and the extendable catepillar.\n-Before I forget, THE SPEED DASH IS A MUCH WELCOME ADDITION! This aids in the speedy level design because now you have a new way to  take off turbo-charged from a standstill.\n-SUPER SONIC!! Okay, so even if this idea is somewhat ripped off from the Super Saiyan of Dragon Ball Z, it's still awesome to be able to transform into this fiery yellow, superfast, invincible flying blur once you've obtained all the chaos emeralds.\n\nCONS\n-Despite being able to control Tails in the single player mode, it's not nearly as much fun for the second player because they can't really help out much. What's worse is that you can't make Tails fly and lift Sonic to higher places yet (wait til Sonic 3).\n-While the zones are a lot of fun to play through and there are a lot of them, it comes with the price of there being only 2 acts to complete per zone instead of 3 (except for Metropolis Zone). Some stages later on are only a single act long.\n-SOME OF THE BOSSES ARE FAR TOO EASY. It's true. Unlike the first game's bosses in which some were fairly easy, many of Dr. Robotnik's latest contraptions can be taken out in a pathetic matter of seconds.\n\nThat's all the minor complaints I can think of. Everything else about this game rules. It goes without saying that Sonic 2 is a surefire classic, and most every Sonic fan already owns this one. It makes as a great introduction for new fans, and it never gets old, even though it technically is an old-school game.

Sonic 2 is probably the best classic Sonic game (I just wish Tails could fly here), and is pretty much what defined that series in the first place: High speed action and frantic gameplay requireing good reflexes. You can either play as Sonic or Tails, or, you can play as Sonic and have Tails follow you around and mimic your moves, which can come in handy in bosses. Its much more effective, however, if you have a friend control Tails with a second controller. The fustrating thing about that is that the screen still scrolls with Sonic, the player controlling Tails will often get left behind and not reapear for a few moments. It also has a decent 2 player mode. This game is just about right challenge wise and is great for any age. And, in my opinion tottaly beats any classic Mario game hands down!

It has a quirky setting and characters, some odd humor. It doesn't mimic other games, but no others mimic it either. Games of its type are big risks. They risk not attracting a strong following. They risk being bad because they're treading new, untested waters. Such a game, however, can be a gem. The little known Space Station Silicon Valley for the Nintendo 64 is such a game. It was very difficult to find in stores, and none of my friends had ever heard of it. Very little was known about it. Strange, I thought, because this is actually a good game - a very original and clever platform game.\n\nYou control a robot named Evo who has broken into many pieces and is now only a computer chip. Fortunately, Evo has broken apart on Silicon Valley, which is a planet filled with robotic animals. When a robotic animal dies, he can enter it and take control of it. Every animal you control has two abilities, and none of the animals has two of the same abilities, making each one handy in its own way. Given so many different animals to take control of, the game is open ended in many different ways. Puzzles have multiple ways they can be solved, using whatever animal you want. There are occasions when you are required to use certain animals for certain tasks, but how you get those animals is up to you.\n\nYou start most levels inside an animal and have to complete a number of mission objectives. Each level also has side quests: collecting fifteen purple energy balls and a gold medal. To get some of these medals you have to pay very close attention to everything, since there are some very clever things you have to do to obtain it. Sometimes, though, it's just killing all of one type of animal. Killing these animals is not so easy as it might sound. For the most part you'll be using an animal that is weaker than the one you are trying to kill, or at its level. Taking them out requires some strategy, otherwise you can get taken out pretty quickly. Using the animals to solve puzzles is also very challenging. This is where the games gets very clever. They truly require you to use what brainpower you may have, and to pay close attention to details.\n\nI do have some complaints about this game that prevent it from getting a perfect score. While the camera is usually solid, I wish there was a look around view. As a game about solving puzzles and finding items it could at least provide you with a way to get a better look at your surroundings. Another somewhat minor gripe is the fact that the animals are way too slow. Even the ones on wheels or that get speed boosts. This segues into my main complaint of the game - it has an atmospheric tedium surrounding it. Being at such a slow pace, you can't help but feel that large presence of tedium squeezing your brain. There are moments when the tedium stops, but only for the short amount of time the reward lasts. Believe me when I say that once you beat the last level you will be finished with the game, even if you didn't collect everything.\n\nThis is actually a hard game to review. I'm not sure who it appeals to with bland graphics and the tedium. I guess those that like cleverly hidden and hard to get rewards will like this. Those looking for innovation and strange, yet funny, humor will like this. Those looking for a good length quest will find this a blessing. It's too bad, though, that the majority of gamers probably don't fit in the above category, which is why these types of games never make it far. I was looking forward to a sequel.", "summary": "Quirky, clever, yet dreadfully slow-paced", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000}

It did pretty well and eventually it was ported to the SNES, Nintendo 64, Playstation and PC. While it's a spot on arcade port, it's okay when you play it by yourself but best played with other people.\n\nYou start off by choosing to create a player or just picking a squad of two guys from any NBA team to go against the computer for 4 quarters each lasting 15 minutes. Whoever has the most points wins the game. Beat all 29 NBA teams and you will be crowned the grand champion. The game's option screen lets you choose to lower or higher the audio and sound effects, increase or decrease the game's difficulty and to slow down or speed up the game clock. As for creating a player, you choose a name and pin number, then choose a head for your player, color of uniform, how to distribute attribute points, pick a nickname and then save it all so you can use it during the match ups. You can bring up to 3 other players to play 2 on 2 matches at any time. As an added bonus, you can find online and enter various cheat codes to activate different effects, get additional players, courts and a different basketball.\n\nThe PROS: Midway gave us an exact arcade port of the hit arcade game. Everything that was in the arcade game is in here so you won't miss anything. Don't worry about the controls because it is easy to get used to. You can even customize the buttons to your liking. The create a player and cheat codes are welcome additions while the multiplayer portion proves that is where the real fun is at; especially if you and your friends like to trash talk during the match ups.\n\nThe CONS: Nothing else was added to make this port stand out; no extra modes or bonus content means that all is you do is play against the other teams. Also, no matter which difficulty level you put it at, the A.I. players will ALWAYS catch up and make sure they can beat you at the last possible second. It can get frustrating when your shots are suddenly blocked with perfect precision, get shoved to the ground with lightning accuracy and have the A.I. players make perfect shots no matter where they are in the court. You will lose games every so often and to earn more attribute points for your created player, you have to win 4 games in a row for 2 APs and that's the ONLY way to earn them. At least when you play against other people, you level the playing field enough for the game to be enjoyable.\n\nThere's nothing special about NBA Hangtime. It's a perfect arcade port so you won't miss anything if you didn't play it in the arcades. It's a game best played with other people as the A.I. players make sure you don't win by a landslide and do whatever it takes to rob you of a win right down to the last second in the fourth quarter.

Particuly the \"dunks from anywhere\" and \"unlimited fire\" codes. Because it's more fun to play with those codes sometimes then it is to play this difficult game. The stratagy compared to JAM is a lot harder and makes it less fun IMO, you can't just turn up the juice and kick your opponents a## in this one because the computer will always make a comeback instantly every single time, even if you get 20 points ahead all of a sudden you cant sink a bucket, your instantly blocked by the comp or it will steal from nowhere and there 3 pointers never miss even with players who in real life cant shoot for $#!%.\n\nIt is very hard to block or grab rebounds against the computer, shots don't go in nicely like in NBA JAM,  and it's difficult enough to get on fire, let alone, stay on fire with the cheating computer instantly making come backs to make it a hard to win matchup everytime... eventualy you do work out the stratagy and it becomes a challenge to win instead of being fun to play.\n\nThere are some cool new options tho, the graphics are better then the old SNES Jams and there is new cool dunks and ally oops, double dunks, and \"team fire\" where if you can make 3 ally oops in a row both of your teamates become on fire with a blue colored flame. The create a wrestler is a cool idea, but you cant do much then just choose heads and attributes and a nickname.. tho I dunno what more you could create for a basketball game? Maybe a whole new team or something and a cheat to get max points, you have to win 4 games in a row to 2 new atributes... ok if you have a memory card, but it sucks if you don't and all data is lost when the machine is turned. Why does it use a memory card???? The SNES versions never needed to use them, and it takes up little space on the memory card, enough to have been in a battery backup option.\n\nOverall I'd much rather be playing the much funner versions on the SNES then this one... I don't like that there is no \"unlimitd on fire\" or \"unlimited team fire\" cheat. The code \"461\" does enable a cool out=door, street style court to play on which is a lot easier on your eyes then the red and orange of the usualy looking indoor courts (codes hold left, block, block ...[<200])... but unless you are playing this game with 4 people then its no fun. probably a lot of fun with a game shark, but not on its own.. and when you get through the 29 teams, there is no cool ending like on the SNES one where it showed video things of real dunks... this one just rolls credits and says thanks for letting us waste your time.", "summary": "Nothing compared to the previous versions of NBA JAM", "unixReviewTime": 1111190400}

The game also included a create a player mode, a mode where instead of speding a few quarters at the arcade, you can createyour very own basketball player, by controlling how tall you want him, how good he can block you, and even how good his aim is for the hoop.\nAlthough many people aren't interested in NBA Hang Time as much as they're interested in newer games that came out for Playstation 2 and XBOX, but there are some new gamers out there who have the Nintendo 64, that might want to enjoy the 2 on 2 Basketball fever.

Enemies on screen.  Full heal after every level up.  A more free turn-based battle system.\n\nDungeon maps - All characters can treasure hunt the hidden items.  Not just specific characters forcing you to switch when needed.  Dungeons are free to enter and exit without penalty.  1st game dungeons were tied to missions and entering/exiting the dungeon was part of it.\n\nQuest system - Shows you which shares it will affect and how much by percentage, which is a big plus.  Can do and complete quests at the player's leisure.  You can choose to submit all completed quests or just some or none anytime you want.\n\nStory - Actually has one.\n\nWorld map - No more terraportation (at least I'm hoping.

The storyline is a continuation of the first game which I admit to not having played although I didn't feel it hindered being able to jump right into this one.  You have to come to the rescue of the land of Gamindustri (okay, say it with me Game Industry) and save the CPUs (Console patron Units) from the evil group known as ASIC (Arfoire Syndicate of International Crime).  Ya...there's a lot of that kind of stuff in the game.  But at its core it's a nice little smirkish take on the gaming industry as a whole so I give credit to the developers Compile Heart and Idea Factory, and the publisher NIS America for employing a good sense of humor about the whole affair.\n\nIF and Compa arrive in Gamindustri to find Neptune . IF represents Idea Factory while Compa represents Compile Heart.  With me so far?  They manage to free Nepgear and together they must locate the mascots of the landmasses, who can provide the power to assit the captive CPUs. They, along with the other CPU candidates eventually join Nepgear's party, and together attempt to free the captive CPUs.  Silliness of the plot aside, and it is seriously silly but also a lot of fun, HN MK2 is an interesting little hybrid RPG.\n\nYou move about the world through an old-style map that might take you back to the days of the original NES system, visiting various cities and exploring dungeons.  Cities are where you can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items for any character in your party.  As you progress through the game, even more items become available which can aid your characters in a variety of important ways such as increasing your defenses, attacks, HP, movement.  I was surprised at the level of item options that were available.\n\nChirper (a play on Twitter) is your communications system.  This basically allows you to listen in on conversation between NPCs.  These can often be pretty mundane and tend to slow the game down but it's a necessary evil to discover random events that can help your party.  Guilds are located in each town that offer quests for the party that involve actions like defeating a certain monster or foe or collecting items.  Successfully completing the quest nets you a reward.\n\nThe combat system is also an ode to RPGs of days gone by.  First of all combat is turn-based.  Yep you head me right, turn-based RPG combat.  Told you it was old school!  When its your turn your party members can move about the area up to the max of the movement points or perform a range of varied attacks.  These take the form of combo attacks that are performed with different button presses, attacks that can reduce the opponents guard meter, as well as finishing attacks.  On top of that, characters also have an SP gauge, which increases whenever they deal or take damage as well as when they end their turn. SP is used to activate special skills, such as healing spells and damaging techniques.  Combat is a lot of fun although quite easy.  Honestly the challenge is minor league at best.\n\nHN MK2 excels in its cartoon/Anime style graphics.  The game definitely earns an M rating with its skimpy costumes and highly suggestive comments, but it's all more cutesy and mature when it comes right down to it.  This isn't a game for everyone but certainly if you're an Anime fan or fan of RPGs from days long past, Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 can offer a solid 20 - 30 hours of gameplay.", "summary": "Surprisingly entertaining", "unixReviewTime": 1334707200}

They are semi glossy, medium profile and a tad tacky, overall giving a great tactile feel.\n-Awesome feature set from the macro live recording to the shift plus feature. Everything you could really need for gaming is here. The thumbster buttons and macro buttons are a must have feature now that I've experienced them.\n-Key visibility is improved since first release. I've read a few complaints that the keys were not visible with the back-light off and from an angle with the back-light on. This has been fixed. Great job Roccat.\n-COMFORTABLE. The wrist rest is perfect and the lower profile keys feel like a dream.\n-The Isku looks serious, futuristic and flashy without looking tacky. It is right at that line though.\n-Keys are lit brightly enough and have an adjustable auto-dim feature which is very cool.\n\nNegs:\n-I'm not a fan of the glossy finish on the detail of the keyboard. Thumbprints stick everywhere. On something that has your hands on it all of the time, I think matte would have made much more sense.\n-Back-lighting looks somewhat cheap and inconsistent. On the enter key and a few other keys, the back-lighting leaves the character insufficiently lit. Example: The EN is brighter than TER on the enter key. The thumbster keys are a lighter blue than the rest of the keyboard also.\n-Thumbster keys are a great addition but are clicky and require complete accuracy to press. Also if you happen to change your assignments to these keys you will have to re assign a profile selector. I think they should have integrated a dedicated profile switch.\n\nConclusion: For this price level, the Isku has an unbeatable and innovative feature set. It somewhow makes me smile when I type on it. The keyboard feels solid and looks great. I think at its recommended price it may be a little less competitive.

One of THE most annoying concepts is that if you have any profile set as \"Windows\" it will not allow you to activate any other profile- perhaps it works if you enter a gaming program- but it does NOT work with regular windows programs. Apparently it thinks that even if you have another program as central focus, it is still 'Windows'.  I had to remove the Windows profile setting and choose different software programs to trigger the appropriate profile- downside- it will not revert back to the main Windows profile upon closing a software program.  I 'fixed' this by pairing the profile I use with Windows to a couple of programs that I normally use but which don't require their own profile.\n\nSince I don't use it for gaming, I have the lights turned off.  I did find it annoying that the macro record would also record pauses, but you can go in to the driver software and edit your recorded macros, deleting out all the pauses.

NEXT has elements of Empires and its base is Dynasty Warriors 7: Xtreme Legends.  NEXT also includes some quick-time elements and has a few other gameplay additions that inject some new blood in the series.\n\nThe Vita has one of the most impressive launch line-ups I've seen and it is easy for a title such as this to be ignored, and that's understandable considering the saturation of the Dynasty Warriors series, though that shouldn't discourage you from picking this game up if you enjoy the gameplay these titles deliver.

It comes with a Campaign (story) mode and a Conquest mode for single players, as well as a Coalition Mode which uses the Vita's ad-hoc feature to set up games between other vita players. You will also receive bonuses for your characters if people on your friends' list have the game and are playing it, even in single player modes.\n\nThe action is pretty similar to Dynasty Warriors 6 & 7, with a few additions. The Vita's touchscreen can be used to perform Musou or Break attacks as well as deflect arrows or cut enemies during cut scenes, Duels are also done entirely with the touchscreen. In order to increase the power and range of some Musou attacks you'll need to shake the Vita, which is my only annoyance so far. I'm not a big fan of shaking consoles or controllers, especially when it's something this expensive. Thankfully you can turn it off in the Control settings by setting \"Motion Sensor Functions\" on \"No\".\n\nFor a release date title, I'd say it's very polished and fun. The graphics are amazing for a portable game, the music is surprisingly good and I haven't had any frame rate issues so far. There's a fully functional character creator but I haven't had the time to test all of it yet. The controls are easy and the camera is not as bad as it has been in the past.\n\nI'm not sure if Japanese voices are an option later in the game or through DLC, but I would appreciate if Techmo-KOEI added them since the English voice acting has always been rather cringe worthy.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Dynasty Warriors series and you own a Vita you will definitely want this title. For those who are unfamiliar with the series I can honestly say this is one of the best titles currently available for the Vita and worth getting if you're into action games.", "summary": "Button mashing fun on the go", "unixReviewTime": 1329868800}

And let me stress the flaws first, because to me they're flaws, to you they might not be.\n\nAs an aside Dynasty Warriors NEXT is not a new game.  It was one of the launch titles for Vita.  I wanted to try it but the Vita is and was severely overpriced.  Fortunately, I found hundreds of dollars of games I had no intention of playing, and it negated the cost of the hardware.  I did see plenty of reviews about the game that all said the same thing, which is the #1 flaw of the game: the duel system.\n\nDuels were introduced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynasty-Warriors-4/dp/B00007KQE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynasty Warriors 4</a>, I believe, with a one-on-one battle with an enemy general that was obscenely overpowered.  They were dropped temporarily in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynasty-Warriors-5/dp/B0009VI7VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynasty Warriors 5</a>, but KOEI kept toying with the concept.  In NEXT they went too far to the right.  Instead of an optional, selectable activity that might just cost you morale, it's now a mandatory activity that the enemy can trigger whenever they please.  This is made even worse by the fact that the duel can disrupt anything; combos, musou, horseback, anything.  It would have been much better - and more authentic - to be challenged to the duel and be offered the opportunity to accept or reject it.\n\nBut let's say for the moment that the auto-accept is fine.  The dueling itself is not a fun exercise, and it's made worse by the weapon system and stat system flaws (later).  This is a flick-spam event similar to paper-rock-scissors where you have to counter your opponent's move and attack.  You don't really have total control over the experience, and some characters are not implemented well.  The Qiao sisters, for example, don't register every flick, so you might on the verge of a fantastic counter, only to have your character stand there and get plowed.  Also, you might connect with hits that do no damage, or if the enemy hits you with a strong blow, you get staggered enough that they can spam that attack, rendering you defenseless and incapable of countering.  Lastly, your enemy can take way more damage than you can, every time, due to the flawed energy/life system (later).\n\nIn previous Dynasty Warriors games, your exploits cause you to level up by gaining experience on the battle field.  This was a staple of Dynasty Warriors since&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynasty-Warriors-3/dp/B00005RL4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynasty Warriors 3</a>, and to see it essentially removed completely was disheartening.  Repeated battles get you little more than the slim chance of getting stronger weapons, which are really the only way to get anywhere in the game.  Even the widely panned&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynasty-Warriors-6/dp/B00104KJ4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynasty Warriors 6</a>&nbsp;and the entertaining-yet-late&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynasty-Warriors-7/dp/B004HVKA9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynasty Warriors 7</a>&nbsp;had this capability.  Unfortunately, NEXT seems to have fallen prey to some mythical preference of \"fast and furious\" in lieu of proper leveling and control of the gaming experience.  Since you don't and can't level, you honestly don't have full control of the experience at all.\n\nSpeaking of the \"fast and furious\", I read an article that the developer saw the popularity of certain first person shooters and games of the sort where there is no energy bar, but rather a regen system and a reddening of the screen to display damage.  The problem with this approach, faulty as it is, lies with the fact that this is not (A) a first person game, (B) a shooter game, or (C) the same experience as the past 7 games and their various offshoots.  It made absolutely no sense to implement such a system and it's clear they tacked it on, since the meat buns, weapons, items, and stats all clearly show a numeric representation of energy remaining.  It reminds me of what they did with DW6 where they just had an endless combo type system instead of the usual regular/strong custom combo system.  The new energy/life system makes it seem like even peons are stronger than they should, rendering you red after 2-3 hits on Hard mode no matter how high your health level is.  That's not what should be happening.  Also, if you go red in a duel, it stays red and you don't recover even if your opponent isn't hitting you.  After you leave the duel, you're vulnerable, so if you're surrounded, one peon hit can kill you.  WAY unbalanced.\n\nWeapons no longer have a defined escalation path.  Instead of collecting various weapons progressively stronger until you get Green Dragon (Guan Yu) or whatever, you get stronger weapons that may or may not be what you want, and you're stuck with a bunch of weapons that you can't then use.  In some cases, weak weapons give you 6 hits where strong ones give you 4 or 5, or weaker weapons give you stat bonuses that the stronger ones do not.  Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Warriors-Orochi/dp/B000T7P4W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Warriors Orochi</a>, you can't just combine stats and skills from weapons to make your ultimate weapon either.  Another example of not being able to control your gaming experience the way you want to.\n\nThe final flaw has to do with KOEI's compulsion to use every single one of the Vita's various gimmicks, in some cases unnecessarily so.  If there's a feature, it's here.  Whether it's flicking, shaking, swiping the back screen (which is clunky), swiping the front screen...pretty much everything EXCEPT button pressing, it's here.  There's something to be said about the simplicity of just using buttons to get the point across.  As with duels, this should be an optional activity that has normal buttons as an alternative for those who want a conventional experience.  The sheer amount of clunky gimmick thrown in here is enough to be detracting because, just like duels, you're thrown into these events with a very jarring experience.  They wouldn't be so bad if you could opt out of them in favor of some decreased morale, or even slight damage.\n\nI'm hoping that as was the case with DW6, KOEI realizes the error of this experiment and goes back to the formula that works.  In fact DW7's formula was on a perfect track by freshening things up a bit.  All they really need to do is fix the fundamental flaws in the core application - flaws that have gotten worse over time yet can no longer be excused with the power of the hardware we're working with.  Enemies still pop in and there's a low number of total enemies that can be on the screen, which makes no sense.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ninety-Nine-Nights/dp/B000FLZEXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ninety-Nine Nights</a>&nbsp;proved that such a limitation is a myth when properly executed and it's beyond me why KOEI refuses to address this one significant issue that has plagued them for years.  Also, the graphics are great in the duels, but still not up to par on the regular battlefield.  By now we should be seeing an experience like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kessen-III/dp/B0006G4KRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kessen III</a>&nbsp;and yet, we don't.", "summary": "Note the fun rating.

TBUL. (To be updated later)\n\n*Character Creation: This is the true feature that was the deciding factor to buying this game, i really like games with a Character Creation System (SoulCalibur V, White Knight Chronicles II and Odyssey Ragnarok, Phantasy Star Online II among a few others being the most recent examples of such a feature) and Dynasty Warriors: NEXT has this feature almost completely hidden as its almost never spoken of throughout many reviews i've read and watched, and if it is mentioned it is for only a second like its just some meaningless extra, well to me its a system seller and im sure other creative people think the same to.\n\nFor the record the mode in question is called \"Edit Mode\" very... misleading is it doesn't state \"Edit what?\" when i first heard of the mode i thought it was for weapons or maybe making your own maps (Which would have been cool to and would love to see this added to the franchise later or some other game franchise.)\n\nIt's also the only reason i bought Dynasty Warriors 6: Empires and skipped the original Dynasty Warriors 6 itself and also skipped DW7 and DW7: XL, since 3 of those 4 most recent Dynasty Warriors games lacked character creation mode. and its finally back in Dynasty Warriors: NEXT!\n\nGranted though for the most part if your still reading this and very interested, your most likely wondering \"Whats New?\" well let me tell you, not much, its almost an exact copy of Dynasty Warriors 6: Empires Character Creation mode, however there are more then a few noticeable changes, some negative but most positive.\n\nPositive:\n\n1. New outfits, there are at least 5 new sets of armor/clothing that DW6: Empires did not have for your original chaos makers, rest assured you'll be looking stylish when bringing the chaos.\n\n2. Stats, customizable stats, as there no true leveling system this time other then the \"Rank System\" meaning you can make your own original characters unique un' to them selves by altering the way they'll behave in general from a status standpoint. The classes or \"Roles\"/whatever there called are as follows...\n\n*Leader ~ AoE Class, best against taking out Legions of enemies quickly,\n*Military ~ DPS Class, best against taking out enemy officers. Note: Im not sure if this effects duels yet, will look into this more later.\n*intellectual ~ Stealth Class, best choice for those who want to ignore the frontlines in general and just go straight for enemy territory and bases, captures bases the quickest compared to the other two, but lacks the extra benefits in combat the other two have as a result.\n\nConclusion: Coming Soon...\n\nFinal Thoughts: Coming Soon...", "summary": "The best Dynasty Warriors game, the best PSVita game.", "unixReviewTime": 1333065600}

If you are interested in this collection take a look at for some gameplay videos of these games and see for yourself.\n\nA final note, if you have a 3D-TV that does 2D to 3D conversion, most of these games (especially SSF2T-HD Remix) look phenomenal!!!", "summary": "I give this my \"M.

Even at the original price of $40, paying for each of the 8 titles separetly would cost $100 on the Xbox marketplace (as of November, 2012) (and includeing the Rocketmen DLC). But currently you should be able to buy this for $30 new, and about $15-$20 used. Which means if you're thinking about buying one of the currently-priced games at $15 (either Bionic Comando: Rearmed 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo  HD Remix, or Flock) then you might as well consider buying this collection. The other five games in the collection are still priced at $10 on the marketplace, so even if only two hold your interest right now, you're still better off getting the collection. Even if Capcom had a huge blowout sale at 50% off, all these games would still cost you $50.\n\nEach of the 8 games is the same version you'd find digitally on the Xbox marketplace, all the features, achievments, and multiplayer support is exactly the same, and players using this disc collection can easily play with those that bought the original digital versions. Plus you'll always have a physical copy of the game, even if Capcom desides to discontinue and remove any of these games in the future. Of course, you still need the disc in order to play anything.\n\n  The High-Profile Games:\nBionic Commando: Rearmed 2 -- (currently still 1200 points on marketplace) The well-recieved sequal to the original digital remake of the classic NES title. This second game is unhindered by needing to be designed by the constraints of the original, and is favored amoung the fans, plus it adds 2-player coop through the whole campaign.\n\nSuper Street Fighter 2: Turbo HD Remix -- (1200 points) A faithfully reproduced HD version of one of the best fighting games around, and its online net code offers some of the smoothest online play for a series that is renowned and requires split-second timing.\n\nFinal Fight: Double Impact -- (800 points) Is actually two arcade ports in one, the original Final Fight and another Capcom action game, Magic Sword. Not only do we finally get the definative arcade port of Final Fight, both games have a number of visual options and settings. You can play the original version, add a bluring effect to smoth out some of the edges, add scanlines, and you can taper the edges of the screen like a real arcade cabinet (or combine some effects).\n\nFlock -- (1200 points) It's kinda a strech to call this a \"high-profile\" game, but it is the only other game that still retails for $15, and I've NEVER seen it on sale since its release.  You basically heard sheep in the game, but its rather fun and addictive, and there's a good amount of content to keep you busy. If you were always curious about this game, but never thought it was worth the $15, then this collection is the BEST way to experience it.\n\nAND THE REST?:\nSuper Puzzle Fighter Turbo HD Remix -- (800 points) is certainly worth checking out. It has fun, simple yet addictive gameplay the has graced the series for years.\n\nWolf of the Battlefield -- (800 points) is actually a direct sequal to the original Commando arcade series. Its the third in the series, and it tries to modernize the Commando-style action. Its not a horrible game, but its not a highlight of the package.\n\nThe rest of the games are enjoyable, but are mostly there to round out the collection. Rocketmen: Axis of Evil (800 points) can be a lot of fun, and you also get the DLC pack (worth 400 points) with it, so at least you get a good amount of content. 1942 (800 points) is a simple HD interpretation of the original acrcade classic.", "summary": "This is $100 Worth in One Collection, Do Not Miss It", "unixReviewTime": 1351814400}

I also purchased, on Amazon, the pre-FAT32 formatted Digistor PS3 backup drive.  Being a 500 gb FAT32 drive, the Digistor now temporarily serves as a PC backup, PS3 backup, and a Xbox 360 Slim external drive.\nThat drive worked great installing the Fallout 3 GOTY disc one, and the game plays without the disc in constant spinn.  The problem was with disc two which contained all of the DLC packages.  That disc WILL NOT install to an external device.  On the dashboard, you cannot access the Game Details section and select install to device.  The disc will automatically give you an error message stating that you need to install an internal hdd.\nThus, I had to purchase this drive since it would be a bit silly budget-wise to purchase a 300 some gb MS drive marked up to such an extent that it costs almost half of an actual console.\nThis drive arrived very quickly, like 2 or 3 business days from CA to NY.  The packaging consisted of a lot of plastic wrap and a little box that screamed \"Made in China/fake knockoff.\"\nNonetheless, I can confirm that the GOTY disc two installs and works flawlessly.  I don't have gold subscription so anything regarding online play, I would not know.\nI mostly use my PS3 while the Xbox Slim serves as a machine that I only use when I really want a exclusive title or if certain title's such as Bethesda's supposedly have more issues on the PS3.\n\nMost people are also concerned with how this drive affects System Updates (do you have to remove prior to dl?), long-term reliability, and ability to play original Xbox titles and other Live DLC (I can't say either way).\nHowever, I would also be interested in knowing if anyone can comment, esp. about the System Updates.", "summary": "Hopefully an informative review (deals with GOTY disc install)", "unixReviewTime": 1357257600}

All you really do is drive a truck.  Sure, there are additional things to do like by garages, hire drivers, expand your fleet, etc, but this game is all about the driving.  And it does that really, really well.\n\nFor a game released in 2013, the graphics aren't really anything to write home about.  It looks like a PS3 game released in 2009.  It's not a bad thing, just a thing.  I assume this is because the developers are an independent studio without the resources of a developer with publisher backing.  Don't expect great textures, but again, you don't need them.\n\nThe driving is really, really fun.  I really don't know why.  You just drive.  Pick a job off the job board and drive.  All the jobs require you haul some specific product or resource from point A to point B.  You can gain extra XP by transporting fragile or explosive payloads.  You also have to drive carefully.  Failure to follow the rules of the road will result in penalties and/or fines.  You better turn your lights at night, signal when you turn and drive on the correct side of the road.  If you don't, you'll pay the price.\n\nHonestly, it's not a game I can marathon because it's fairly repetitive; but I love sitting down for 30 minutes and completing 3-4 jobs, earning a little money and making sure my driving team is keeping busy.  I also think the menus could be a bit more friendly.  They can be tricky to navigate, in my opinion.\n\nYes, the game is playable on keyboard and XBox 360 controller, but I suspect a wheel is really the way to go.  I've not played with a wheel, but I'm doing just fine with a controller and some minor tweaking.\n\nKudos the developers for creating a compelling game.

Kaplan", "reviewText": "I bought Super Monkey Ball for Vita mostly out of a misplaced sense of nostalgia.  I was a huge fan of the original Gamecube game, spending all hours of the night with college friends playing Monkey Target and other great minigames.  And 11 years later, I was ready to recapture that fun.\n\nUnfortunately, that's all SMBBS really is: fan service and little more.  All the components are still there: solid level design in the main challenges, minigames, and so on.  But what's there is not really well implemented on the Vita.  Optional tilt controls are best avoided, as the Vita's gyroscope is simply not up to the task of handling the precision required by the main levels.  Sadly, the left analog stick doesn't fair much better, as the rather loose Vita analog doesn't allow for much of a range between barely moving and full throttle.  You'll find yourself rocking the analog back and forth uncomfortably in jarring motions, constantly fighting the game's singularly awful camera.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the gameplay just hasn't held up well.  The main stages quickly ramp up in difficulty and are well designed, but everything else feels rote and by-the-numbers.  Even the supposed track creation function only allows you to generate a semi-random track using found/photographed objects.  The minigames are largely the same as those you've seen before, and the once highly-addictive Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are relegated to easy, poor-controlling shadows of their former selves.  If you're a fan, you've seen this all before, and probably in a better-controlling form.\n\nThe graphics are decent but not exceptional.  Colors pop on the Vita's screen but textures are poor (the water in the Monkey Target stage looks like something from the N64 era).  Sound is pretty much what you'd expect.\n\nAll of this would be acceptable enough, except you're essentially getting a redux of an 11 year-old game for $30. Yes, it's cheaper than the average Vita game, but it would still be better placed as a $10 downloadable.  As is, I can't recommend buying Super Monkey Ball at this price unless you're a diehard fan who salivates at the thought of wrestling a poor camera and spotty controls in order to perform speed runs on tough (and admittedly decent) designed courses.

There are 50 Advanced courses which start off at a high level of challenge, rivaling the hardest levels on the first two games right from the start. You'll struggle to make it to the end, but for a game like Monkey Ball, that's a good thing! What other replay value would there be if you didn't have to learn the stages in order to succeed?\n\nFor those who are new to the series, there is plenty of casual-friendly content, too. The Beginner and Normal modes are very accessible, and there are tons of mini games, some of which are worth spending a couple hours messing around with.\n\nA new feature is the ability to generate random levels by having the game turn photos into courses. You take a picture of anything, and the game will attempt to make a stage that looks like the picture. The level variety in this mode is a little lacking, but if you buy a $2 optional DLC from the Playstation Store, you can add a lot more pieces which add tons of challenge to it, and I've even seen it generate a course I was unable to complete. This adds a lot of replay value for anyone, as you can just mess around with random levels if the main game is frustrating you. This is also a great mode to play to hone your skills when you don't have enough time to play through the full game in one sitting.\n\nFor new players, one thing that may confuse or irritate you is how you move the ball in the main game. You actually tilt the level itself rather than move the ball. Yes, pushing to the left does move your ball left, but it accomplishes this technically by tilting the level. The game doesn't really explain this, but it's important to know. For example, if you are going very fast and fly off the edge onto a platform below, tiling back BEFORE you land is essential to stopping your ball, as it'll actually bounce your ball backward at an angle, stopping you much more quickly than if you pull back AFTER you land.\n\nAnother thing about the level tilt is that it forces the camera to be automatic; the player can't manually adjust the camera without a keen understanding of the game. The camera attempts to stay behind the player, so turning the camera is a matter of sort of pulling back and to the side to adjust your ball's facing. Newcomers usually complain about this, but it had to be this way because the tilt of the level is based on the player's perspective. If the camera could just be moved all around at will, it would allow you to do some crazy stuff with the tilt mechanics. If you play the game you'll see what I mean, but as a Monkey Ball expert I can tell you that it's something you can learn to account for, and it doesn't detract from the experience once you get accustomed to it.\n\nOne more thing I was happy with was the ability to share content with your friends through the game itself. Any time you complete a stage, you can save a replay, and replays can be uploaded for sharing purposes. Simply giving people your PSN username will allow them to look up your files and download anything you uploaded. Randomly generated stages can also be saved and uploaded.\n\nThere is some content in this game that is terrible: some of the mini-games are bad, and the gyroscope controls are not recommended, but I won't take off stars for modes that weren't important to me anyway. There is enough here to be worth the asking price. If there is any downside to Banana Splitz, it's that the Vita has tiny analog sticks.", "summary": "Worthy Addition for Monkey Ball Fans", "unixReviewTime": 1384905600}

Forget about the \"critics\" and their biased opinions. Here's the scoop from a dude playing the game as we speak...\n\nWhen Ninja Gaiden first came out for the original Xbox, it was one of those games that was insanely hard and frustrating at times, in a good way of course, and it kept me coming back for more; from the awesome combos, to the fluid chopping of limbs, it was  bloody, gore heaven made in a disc.\nNow the PS Vita version is out and I must say, IT IS GREAT! Don't be fooled by bad reviews accusing the game of being a poor rushed port of an old game, because it isn't. Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus has kept me playing all afternoon and will do so for the rest of the night and probably all week, once I start the hardest mode.\nFans of the original will appreciate the fact that the game has kept its insane hard levels, those new to the series or those who are simply trying to have a bit of gore before lunch is over, will be happy to know that this version of the game has an easy mode, that as the word implies, makes the game a breeze to play when you don't have much time to figure out how to save your own butt from a horde of  bad dudes trying to slice your head... Game modes include Hero Mode (easiest), Normal (challenging ), and Hard (shave your head in advance) and Ninja Trials (think of this as Batman's challenge maps)\n\nThe graphics have been polished and very well done, lighting effects are spot on and I even noticed shadows. But please remember, this game is 8 years old, so don't expect a next generation type of graphics, but they did an exceptional job at it, the game looks amazing. I didn't notice any frame drops, the game, even during heavy battles, kept a nice even flow. The storyline is the same, Ryu is in search of the stolen blade and must avenge his clan's death. You'll fight foes left and right, from samurais, to ninjas to some mystic badass beasts and of course, wicked boss fights.\n\nIf you played the original, I'm sure you remember how frustrating it was to cycle through items such as Elixirs, well, you'll be glad to know that you can know browse through health and ninpo elixirs by using the D-Pad, side ways you chose, down you use, simple.\nAnother great addition, while using the bow and arrow, you can now simply tap the screen and you aim with either the stick or by moving the vita itself, tap on the enemy to shoot at him...again, a heaven sent feature, I hated the original method, I got my butt kicked while aiming. If you want to simply shoot your arrows without precise aiming, simply press the O button. To zoom in and out, use L/R.\nNinpo has also changed, it is activated by pressing two buttons at time (x+o being one), then the screen asks you to tap the rear touch pad of your vita to use the ninpo, which gives your ninpo a \"power up\" option, kinda of a charging option if you must. I personally didn't care for this feature, I like the way it was before, two buttons and away we go. Don't get me wrong though, it is still a nice added feature.\n\nMy advice to you, specially if you are a fan, GET THIS GAME. Don't be fooled by the so called \"critics\" reviews, this game is as always, fun, challenging and now you can have it in the palm of your hands. Trust me, you will like it. If you are new to the series, get ready for a ride, this game is addictive and you'll be coming back for more. Yes, I admit, the story is the same as the original, but how could it change?. The game has added features that give it a refreshing touch that at least, fans of the series, like myself,truly appreciate. I can't review it anymore than this without spoiling the whole experience, so I will let you enjoy it yourself. Peace.", "summary": "Fans Rejoice. A Great Remake.

Took them seven years but they executed it phenomenally.\n\nNinja Gaiden on the Xbox is still one of the most sleek and rewarding action games ever made, but this is a remake of a remake of a remake of Ninja Gaiden- you can now use the right analog stick to control the camera, there are new weapons like the smoke bomb and the visuals are even better than before. The controls take some getting used to but after playing through the first few levels I can confidently say that the Vita's analog stick is up for the task of controlling Ryu Hayabusa. The game is longer than ever with new challenge missions you can unlock by playing the game and there are new costumes to unlock like Rachel's classy new secretary outfit. The game took me around 40 hours to complete on the original Xbox, I'm sure this'll last me at least 60 hours on my first playthrough of all the content available.\n\nThis is a classic game that I'll play for years to come. There's a ton of variety in the campaign and the action is as lightning-fast as ever, there were no compromises in bringing this to the Vita and it really shows off the system's power. I recommend this very highly to anyone who wants a good third-person action game for their new Vita.

If you have any issues with the Vita's button layout, fear not since this game can be played on the Playstation TV with a Dualshock 3 or 4 controller.

Suffice it to say this is Ninja Gaiden Sigma for the PS3, on a portable. Think about that for a second - A PS3 game on a portable. Yes, that game was actually a port from the xbox, but still. The size and scope of this game on a portable device just blows my mind.  While the port itself isn't flawless, the fact that it's the original Ninja Gaiden in all its glory on a portable device makes up for it. This game is just as good as ever, and includes the sigma add-ons to boot. Now, for the Vita specific stuff...\n\nAnyway - so what are the changes? Actually they're quite few. Gone is the goofy \"shake the controller to power ninpo\" mechanic on the ps3, replaced with a slightly less goofy \"press random spots on the back touchpad of the vita to power ninpo\" mechanic. Turning on the Karma counter has been moved to a menu item since the button it would have been mapped to is not present, and going into first person mode is achieved by touching the screen, which works, but I find myself occasionally touching it by accident while moving the camera and this can cause me to drop into first person mode occasionally when I don't want to. More annoyingly, the action button (for opening doors, boxes, etc) has been moved to the circle button, which causes me to occasionally lose an arrow when I accidentally fire it instead of opening some box or door. This is annoying, but not a huge issue.\n\nGenerally the new touch applications of the vita are implemented somewhat haphazardly. As mentioned, you touch the screen to go into first person mode - ok fine. Firing the bow can be attempted either like it always has with the right stick, or more weirdly by pressing the spot you want the arrow to go on the screen, which seems like a good idea, but can lead to some weird effects, especially if you have fat fingers.  You can also aim the bow (or just first person mode) by moving the vita around itself via the gyros, but if you're like me and have the right button axes reversed, this mapping follows into gyro movement and makes completely no sense - you tilt the device up and the screen view goes down. What was really needed was separate options for this control mapping and the right stick FPS mapping. minus points for lazyness.\n\nThis isn't the only touch screen weirdness either. The save file select function is accomplished via touch, but ONLY this - no other menus are touch enabled - which is completely rediculous. This is the kind of thing that should be all or nothing, otherwise, it's just confusing.\n\nGameplay itself is just fine however. The framerate is smooth and there are no noticable changes beyond what was already done in Sigma, so those of you familiar with that game will be able to jump right in and kick ass. I have a slight suspicion, though not anything confirmed, that the difficulty was toned down a notch - I'm currently playing on 'normal' and find my self blowing through battles that would normally be a lot harder - say for instance the motorcycle guys in Tairon - seem much easier than they used to be. On the other hand, Spider Clan ninjas are just as hard as ever, so maybe not.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay -  for all you wimps out there there is a wimp mode called \"hero mode\", which is laughable. Unlike earlier iterations of \"ninja dog\" mode which required you sucking a lot before it was unlocked and came along with constant insults from Ayane, \"hero\" mode is accessible from the start and basically makes you invincible. After your health gets below a certain level, you basically auto-block and have unlimited ninpo, which removes nearly all challenge from the game.\n\nThere is also a hard mode which I haven't tried yet, and I suspect an \"ultimate\" mode as there was in all previous versions of the game, but as I'm still in chapter six, I can't comment yet.\n\nOverall, this is an average port of an excellent game. I can't think of too many people who haven't played the original ninja gaiden, but if you're one of them, this is an excellent time to give it a shot. For those of you who have played it and want something to tide you over until NGIII, or want some quality NG on a portable, this is where to get it. The only complaint at this point would be the price, but soon enough that will likely drop.\n\n4 Stars - minus one for stupid touch UI decisions.", "summary": "Definitely a must have for Vita owners", "unixReviewTime": 1330992000}

This is one of the more 'traditional' games developed by Sting.  Which is not to say this is a Disgaea or FF Tactics clone by calling it 'traditional'.  But unlike the previous Sting titles (Crimson Gem Saga, Yggdra Union, and Riviera), this one bears some semblance to games of the strategy RPG genre.\n\nThe game gives the option of a difficulty setting.  I chose Hard (being a veteran SRPG player), and it's tough without being impossible.  Normal might be a cakewalk for most players.  Of course later in the game I may regret this...\n\nBattles take place on a 3-d isometric grid.  Battles are fun and fluid with plenty of action.  The story is nice and progresses well.  The use of dialogue in battle is a nice dramatic touch.\n\nLeveling is where the game gets interesting and might cause me to replay the game several times.  You can level characters and equipment, then recycle old gear to level up new stuff.  Leveling characters makes them stronger, leveling equipment unlocks bonuses and skills.\n\nAll in all it's fun and very deep.  I wouldn't say as deep as Disgaea games, but definitely rivaling most other strategy RPGS on the PSP.  Buy if you like Sting titles or solid SRPGs like FF Tactics, Tactics Ogre, or Disgaea.\n\n----\nUpdate:\nThe game gets really tough on the advanced difficulty setting.  But what I like is that the programmers didn't make it like Street Fighter where increased difficulty means more damage to you while you hit for less damage on the enemy.  Instead the enemy gets really quite creative.  The AI is impressive.  You find that the enemies will block off your characters so that you can only get one or two in to attack position.  They also set up chain attacks frequently.  The only boneheaded thing they do is they still jump off tall ledges to take damage.  Though this often happens so they can get their character into better position.\n\nIf you don't figure out how to properly deploy and position characters and use the Tactics gauge properly (for those quick charge or whatever they are called - where you spend Tactic Points to hasten your turn), then you will be seeing game over screens a lot.  Even then you will find yourself losing characters frequently.  But it never seems cheap.  It's kind of like \"Ah man, I can't believe I let my character get backed into a corner like that!\".  Just don't get too attached to your characters (except the regular NPC characters), you will lose some.\n\nAlso of note: the decisions you make affect the progression of the game.  When you select whether to slay or spare someone or what course of action to take, it will affect the story.  This encourages multiple plays through though.  I haven't played through a second time, but I look forward to the changes if I select \"To destroy the Empire\" instead of \"To protect others\" when receiving Gungnir.\n\nOh, and I wanted to point out, there is a time limit for battles, but I haven't surpassed the limits yet.  They give you plenty of time though it seems.  I think they just don't want you endlessly farming crystals.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSince you can't optionally level up in this game (no optional battles), you might want to keep a few save files handy.  I got to a point where I had trouble clearing the stage, and sadly had to go back to the beginning of the game and plan my progress better.  As a linear, tough strategy RPG, this is great.  But the linear aspect can be a bit frustrating.  I always enjoyed the optional battles in FFTactics and Disgaea, but this game doesn't have that.

A lot of the titles they've been cranking out recently come across as blatant pitches to snag the smallest niche of anime fans, with uninspired plots, girls with chests bigger than their head, and an emphasis on cheesecake versus original characters and good gameplay. Coming from a lifelong anime fan, that's saying something. Now, on the surface, the \"Agarest War\" franchise looked no different. Here we had marketing reliant on the sexualization of the female characters and no real information about the game itself, and the bonus items which came with the collector's editions reeked of sleaze. Superficially, I hated the game. But with its devoted fanbase, and because a friend with connections pulled aside a copy because he thought I'd like it, I decided to give this new entry a go. Lo and behold, it has turned out to be one of the rare RPGs I plan on playing to completion. \"Record of Agarest War 2\" is nothing groundbreaking, but it's unique and original enough to merit a play.\n\nThe plot starts you off in the shoes of Weiss, who has killed a god but lost all memory of the incident. After a chance encounter with a mysterious and buxom woman clad in borderline dominatrix gear, he is informed that he is in fact to serve as a vessel to atone for the sin of slaying a god, and if he fails his task, he must shack up with a woman and create a child that will serve as a new vessel. As the game progresses, you will indeed have to do just that, and through the span of multiple generations, you'll fight hoards of demons, score with some lovely ladies, and uncover the destiny of your bloodline.\n\nNow, this generation spanning is something that has apparently been a focal point of the entries prior to this one, but as a first-time player, I have to admit that it's absolutely fascinating. Depending on how you interact with the woman you choose as your bride, and how you adjust your statistics through battling, your protagonist's predecessor will change. The sheer notion of a piece of entertainment having such an in-depth feature is definitely a sign that there are some things the interactive medium can do that movies and books will simply never be able to. In fact, I feel that this should have been a primary selling point instead of the cleavage and rear ends of the admittedly attractive ladies in the game.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it was a bit of a mixed bag for me. While I play plenty of JRPGs, and a decent amount of the occasional SRPG, I found myself kind of lost when it came to navigating the plethora of statistics, menus, and other things. While the core combat system is actually quite good (an interesting mix of turn-based fighting mixed with the speed, action and control of a hack-and-slash game, coupled with a dual-grid system), the amount of effort it takes to plan out what gear to equip and whatnot is just irksome. It definitely feels like the developers were intending to make the game come across as \"deeper\" by just adding more hoops to jump through than necessary. The experience as a whole could have benefited from some serious reduction in menu clutter.\n\nWhat makes up for this, in a way, is the very snazzy way battles are paced. There are three or four different types of maps you will find yourself navigated. One is the standard World Map that you run around on to get from one place to another. While you will still encounter random battles, you also have the option to trigger a battle at any time. When grinding for levels, this is an indispensable feature that other RPGs with random encounters should take note of. Having the ability to sit in one place and grind levels until you feel confident enough to progress is a very empowering feeling. The second type of map you'll be navigating are what you might call this game's \"dungeons.\" Bridging areas of the World Map are smaller maps that are divided into several different zones that you progress through in a board game-like fashion. Each tile you progress to instigates a battle, and you can fight as few or as many times as you like. There are diverging paths that feature treasure and other goodies to claim, as well as tiles that will help you meet requirements on the main town's commission board, which will net you spells, armor, and ingredients required for alchemy and blacksmithing.\n\nSpeaking of towns, it houses the third kind of map you'll see. It's a menu that you pick locations on, and then go to them. Pretty straightforward, I know, but it segways into the second major focal point of this game: the dating sim aspect. Now, \"Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love\" set my standard for what to expect from a dating sim/RPG hybrid, and while this certainly doesn't exceed that experience in my book, due to the fairly limited range of conversation, it does almost match it. What it does beat that game in, however, are the production values. Instead of static images, the lovely ladies (and handsome men, if you're into that) are fully animated, living and breathing, all with unique animation that creates an interesting 2D/3D hybrid. This makes the experience as a whole so much more engaging than many other games that try and touch the SW franchise's signature dating sim/RPG blend. I enjoyed getting to know the cast through the interactions, and despite the aforementioned limited conversational choices, it's a defining feature that sets it apart from imitators.\n\nHowever, while the overall story arc and character development is exceptional in \"RoAW2\", I have a serious bone to pick with the dialogue. If you're familiar with the worn cliche many gamers hold about JRPGs, about them having seemingly endless amounts of inane banter that is ultimately redundant, then you know where I'm going with this complaint. To be entirely honest, several lines of conversation in this game have bored me to death, and I like to think that I have a pretty large attention span. But it can't be helped. Characters repeat each other's dialogue, and characters making awkward pauses such as, \"Uh-!\", \"Oh, uh-!\" or the infamous \"...\", happens way too often, frequently occurring multiple times in a row with certain characters. I'm not saying the dialogue is awful, but it's tiresome and wears on the nerves after a while, making the experience seem longer than it is. An \"autoplay\" option helps alleviate the pain somewhat, but only a bit. The story is good, the characters are great, but the dialogue needed some serious work. Also, the font and styling of the text is formatted in a very odd manner. Things are surrounded by hyphens when they should be either italicized, capitalized, or put into quotations, making the emphasis in some dialogue only understandable when the voice actor actually speaks it. Also worth noting is that there is no English voice track. That doesn't bother me one bit, but some may be deterred by that.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite pretty. What really stands out are the exceptional monster designs. Most of the enemies break free of the typical trappings of fantasy RPGs, and some of them are surprisingly frightful to gaze upon. The environments are nice and varied, and the character art is very crisp and appealing to look at. That same overall sentiment can be echoed for the soundtrack, which is infectious and passable enough to give praise to. Nothing too new, but nothing terrible. Overall, pleasant and helps to whisk you off into the fantasy world of the game, which is sometimes too much to ask some soundtracks for. It's always nice when it does happen, though.\n\nWith Square Enix focused on running their two main franchises into the ground, and Atlus branching out into new, more varied territory, it's nice to see Aksys putting out a game that screams niche. But furthermore, it's nice to see that some of these games are quite good, such as this one. While \"Record of Agarest War 2\" will not change your life, it will entertain and thrill you. Futhermore, it will draw you into its own little world, and with games of this variety, what more can you really ask for? This is a solid little game with plenty of nice imagery, a good story, and memorable characters; in this critic's opinion, it's a great title to spend your Summer downtime working on.\n\nPlot: 8\nGameplay: 8\nGraphics: 8\nSound: 8\nOverall: 8\n\nNOTE: If you purchased the Limited Edition, this review is posted on its page as well, but also includes a whole section critiquing the extras that come with it.

The overall game was better than the 2 mobile games, but not as good as the 2 numbered games.\n\nStory  3/5\nThis game definitely contains needed story in order to understand the next numbered game.  Sadly, the story here was about as weak as re:coded.  Primarily, it starts off with almost 0 explanation of what is going on and over the first 1.5 hours you get flash backs kind of queuing you in that this game takes place after KH2 ending.  I was pretty confused and thought I skipped some explanation somewhere.\nAfter that intro chunk, you visit 7 disney worlds, 5 old 2 new so a lot of rehashed material.\nFinally, the main story for the series continues with a super convoluted time travel story that doesn't make a lot of sense.  Even ignoring the not making sense of it, it felt a bit weak.\n\nMusic  3/5\nThere wasn't a ton of new music for this game, and some of the new ones were pretty terrible.  The reused songs from KH1 and KH2 were great as always.  The new ones had some weird techno music that was very jarring.  It might have come from \"The World Ends with You\" as it only played near those characters.  regardless, it didn't fit the classically composed music.\n\nControls  2/5\nI played KH3D on a New 3Ds console with the extra joy stick just for reference.  I found the controls to be touchy and difficult to manage.  The camera often jumped all about and it was difficult to reign it back in.  KH3D borrows the command deck from BbS and I just am not a fan of cycling through a roll of abilities trying to find the spell I need while also trying to dodge enemies and control an overly sensitive camera.\n\nGraphics 5/5\nFor a 3Ds game, KH3D was beautiful.  It was easily on par with the ps2 numbered games.  I had no issues with the appearances.  The Dream Eater monsters were a bit too colorful for me, but not a deal breaker.\n\nOther\nPossibly the worst aspect for this game is the Drop system.  You are forced to flip back and forth between stories on a timer.  You could be in the middle of exploring an area and are forced to switch over.  I dislike pointless timers that add needless stress,  Once I unlocked the drop system, the game felt anxious as I no longer had time to explore because a timer was always counting down.\n\nOverall 3/5\nPoor story telling in the beginning and an overly complex time travel story really brought down this side story to the KH series.  The old music was as good as always, but some of the new songs were jarringly bad.  Once again many worlds were reused from disney.  And finally, poor controls and needless timers bring this game down to just an average score.", "summary": "A mixed review from a fan of the entire series", "unixReviewTime": 1464393600}

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "summary": "Twisted Metal Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}

I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning.

Blessen", "reviewText": "Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter.\nBlending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies.\nThe characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating.\nThe interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story.\nThe  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.", "summary": "Original and Literate", "unixReviewTime": 957571200}

An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did.\nGrim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday.\nImagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango.\nThe story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another.\nThe things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!

This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games.\nTrue, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout.\nIf I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized.\nSome people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available.\nThus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.", "summary": "LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future", "unixReviewTime": 956880000}

I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything.\n\nBut, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.\n\nIf polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.\n\nSometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)\n\nIt also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.\n\nBy the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.\n\nAt least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.\n\nTomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.\n\nBOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.", "summary": "spend your money elsewhere", "unixReviewTime": 1154476800}

The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, \"Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery\" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?\nThe game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.\nFinally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.\nFinally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!\nYippee.\nAntarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!\nBut in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.\nIf you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!", "summary": "TOO HARD", "unixReviewTime": 1086998400}

Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it.\nWell Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either.\nYou also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money.\nSimply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term.\nIt's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme.\nBut as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games.\nIf Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely.\nFinally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times.\nBut given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.", "summary": "Lara's the One (on the Playstation)", "unixReviewTime": 966297600}

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.\n\nREASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.\n\nREASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.\n\nIf you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!\n\nA lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.\n\nStory:\n\nYou are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTo complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it.\n\nHyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.\n\nControls:\n\nThey work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.\n\nOcarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.\n\nMusic:\n\n*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.\n\nSome later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P\n\nOh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :(\n\nReplay Value:\n\nIt's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations.\n\nLike in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard).\n\nBut if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.\n\n______\n\nIf you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.\n\nThis is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.\n\nThe introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).\n\nThis is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.\n\n(Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)", "summary": "One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!", "unixReviewTime": 1238371200}

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.\n\nOne thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.\n\nThe dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.\n\nWhile normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.\n\nLet's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.\n\nThe storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.\n\nThe dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.\n\nThe enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.\n\nDo you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.\n\nThe game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.\n\nIf you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.\n\nGanon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.\n\nA few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.\n\nBasically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.\n\nReading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).\n\nRecognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!", "summary": "a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star", "unixReviewTime": 1374796800}

GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with \"slappers only.\"\n\nIn addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill.\n\nThe music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different.\n\nThe game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives).\n\nWhether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it.

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems.\n\nThe single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it.\n\nThere are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby.\n\nThe computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there.\n\nLarge maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000.\n\nIf you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.", "summary": "Same as the original", "unixReviewTime": 1108512000}

Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.\n\nStill maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.\n\nSome of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.\n\nThe second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.\n\nThis game is pretty realistic.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam.\nThe concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it.\nSome other pros-\nBeing a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer.\nAlmost always runs smoothly.\nStill a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play.\nCheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack.\nVery colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later.\nA 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game.\nA seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet.\nThe opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank.\nThere are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play.\nOver all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods.

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome.

It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence.\n\nAnyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.\n\nLet's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands.\n\nOh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.\n\nWhereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"", "summary": "banjo kapooie", "unixReviewTime": 1376265600}

This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.\n\nThe Good:\n+ A fun story\n+ An imaginative use of its characters\n+ Creative worlds to explore\n\nThe Bad:\n-- Too easy and short\n-- The few parts that are too hard\n\nThe Ugly\n? Why is Kazooie so insulting?\n\nStory--9/10\n\nThe first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?\n\nGameplay--8/10\n\nHere is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?\n\nThere are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing).\n\nThese are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.\n\nLongevity--5/10\n\nA game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.", "summary": "A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000}

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030.

Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay).

The previous two games didn't really live up to the title of 'Tomb Raider' as there weren't many tombs involved at all, but The Last Revelation takes advantage of its trademark name by putting Lara back into the tombs - where she belongs! This was the third Tomb Raider game I bought, after Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider 2, and I have to say it is one of the most exciting and enjoyable games I have ever played. The Offical PlayStation Magazine says, \"10/10 - An atmospheric, beautiful, wonderfully crafted game\". And you know what? They're absolutely right...\n\nThe story of The Last Revelation is very intricate - gripping, without being too unbelievable. While exploring Egypt, Lara discovers the lost tomb of the Ancient Egyptian God, Set. He was outwitted and imprisoned in a secret tomb, and warns that he will one day return to seek vengance. Lara unwittingly unleashes its ancient evil, fulfilling the prophecy that threatens to plunge mankind into eternal darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all her wit and skill to re-imprison Set to save the world from unspeakable evil and Armageddon! The Last Revelation begins with a flashback level from the 1980's when Lara was 16 on her first exploration in Angkor Wat, Cambodia. She is led around by her mentor, Werner Von Croy. This is really just a training level that teaches new Tomb Raider players the ropes on how to control Lara. After this, the game really begins - in the present day. We learn that on their escape from the tomb in Cambodia, Lara left Von Croy to die after the tomb began to collapse around her. It's not long, however, until we find out that Mr Von Croy is indeed alive and well, and on the look out for Lara to get revenge! The game is split into six different sections; Training Levels, Recovering the Amulet of Horus, Discovering the Truth, The Search for the Armor, The Search for Jean-Pierre and The Final Conflict. This game has been giving a rating of 11+, but I think it should be at least a 15+ because the graphics are much better than the first two games, making everything look more life like. I admit that some of the levels on this game, especially towards the end scared me to death! I used to sit there with both eyes squinted, scrwaming my head off as the sweat used to pour from my hands...pretty sad when you think about it now! Despite this, the levels are amazingly intricate and full of life and colour - much more detailed than any of the games in the series. Since the game is set entirely in Egypt, you get a real feel to what life is like over there and almost become part of the game. This game took me nine months to complete (December 1999-September 2000) and I have to say that I enjoyed every second of it! Lara has a variety of new features and you also have to go back and forth between levels to find a particular object that will open the door to the finale. The cut-scenes that run through the entire game to tell the story are absolutely mind-blowing. The graphics are brilliant - it's just like watching a film...and Lara's boobs seem to get bigger as the series goes along! The last level truly is one of the greatest, most spectacular levels in video gaming history which involves a confrontation with the God Set! In the final cut-scene of the game, Lara is seen exiting the crumbling tomb to find Von Croy at the entrance. Emotion takes over and he puts out his hand, but it's too late. The tomb collapses with Lara still inside. This really was a tense moment for Tomb Raider fanatics as they were left wondering if this was it for Lara, if there favourite compuiter game series was over for good. They need not have worried as Tomb Raider: Chronicles and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness followed!\n\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\n\nAll in all, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is a must-have game for Tomb Raider fans and for anyone who enjoys computer games in general. But be warned, this game requires a lot of time, effort and determination. If you want to get everything right on the first time, you're best off not buying this game because you'll just hate it. Yet for people who want an exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed blockbuster of a video game, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the game for you!

I'm more a roleplayer than an action gamer, but there's enough character involved in the Tomb Raider series to keep me interested.\nLara's adventures follow the same basic mold as _The Mummy_ or the _Indiana Jones_ movies; she goes poking about in ancient sites and gets involved in Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (and that Woman Was Meant To Put Right, apparently!). Being action-oriented, the game gives you a wide range of motion, and does a nice job of making you feel the difficulty and danger of some of her feats -- jumping over pits filled with spikes, swinging on ropes over chasms, climbing sheer cliffs, swimming through shark-infested waters, and so on. In The Last Revelation, the dark Egyptian god Set is unleashed upon the world, partly through Lara's ending up somewhere she shouldn't have been, and so Lara has to put a stop to his rampage. Normally one human against a god would be a silly idea, but then again, the last time Set was loose, human beings didn't have fully automatic weapons, bazookas, and grenades.\nThe game fails to get a perfect rating from me based on my own preferences and skills. Firstly, because it IS an action game, many of its challenges are based simply on your being good enough to do some particular set of actions very, very well. I'm not the greatest in the world at doing some of the more complex sequences, and this means that it can take a frustratingly long time to get past one challenge -- in some cases, days to either figure out the precise sequence of moves which will get me from one point to the next, or to actually perform the sequence of moves once I've figured it out. Timing is critical, and restarting the game from the last saved point can take an annoying amount of time.\nSecondly, because I'm more a roleplayer, I find the lack of choices in actions somewhat stifling. Yes, I would as a rule choose to go and do the heroic thing, but you don't really get any choice to even be reluctant, go get help, or anything else. You work alone, you volunteer automatically, and so on.\nStill, playing a couple of Lara Croft's adventures showed me why this series still continues; it delivers exactly what it promises, and does so with panache.", "summary": "There's a reason Lara Croft keeps coming back...", "unixReviewTime": 1018742400}

Whoa, this was not what I expected at all, in both a good and bad way.  First, the good side.\nI was always a Nintendo gamer, naturally with a Nintendo 64.  In that case, this game was the first ps1 game I've ever owned.  Knowing that ps came out much earlier than n64, i was amazed by the graphics in this game.  Voice and backgrounds are all very nice and realistic.  Plus you get to play as a teenage Lara, which makes it even better.  You also get even more weapons, moves, and length in this game as well.\nIn this aspect I was very pleased.  But there always is a downfall:  THE CONTROLS!  What an impossible game to play.  And i'm not talking about difficulty, the controls make it difficult.  You move the analog stick from side to side and instead of moving Lara sideways, you just changed the direction of her view.  Then when you are lined up, you must push forward to move.  It is very difficult and some of the views do not help.\nJust to show you how hard this really is to master, I've been playing this game for 2 and 1/2 hours now and still haven't advanced past the training at the beginning.  Ha, and the training barely helps with the controls.  All you will hear is \"To do a long jump, press forward.  Then immediately push JUMP.  Then push ACTION to climb up the ledge.:  Yeah, like you even know what they are talking about or when exactly to push these buttons.\nOverall, I give it 3 stars. Why?  First off, if you are an experienced gamer with Lara, I'm sure this is easier for you.  Second, it is rather enjoyable considering I have tried to play it 5 times now in a course of a day.  At these facts alone, the game deserves a 2.  But hey, it's 10 bucks. Thats it.  For that price, it deserves a better rating.\nBOTTOM LINE:  You've played and like Lara, get this one too.  If you are a beginner like me, try an older version or another console's version of Tomb Raider instead.\nWARNING: Just a warning for all PS2 users, if you only have a PS2, you can't use your normal memory card to save.

Alright. Instead of calling this the best PlayStation game of all time, or even more laughable, one of the best games of all time, or even sadder, the best game of all time, let's get a couple of things straight first, shall we? While not bad, Metal Gear Solid left me wanting more and getting less than you'd think. Hideo Kojima set out to make one thing: a movie-like experience game. On that level, Hideo created an unrivalled masterpiece that has few equals in the action and story category of movies... but that's just it: movie; we're supposed to be playing a game here, not watching a movie. And on that level, while Hideo didn't fail, he didn't succeed either... You play Solid Snake, an ex-Fox-Hound, just out of retirement, cold, 30-something, living legend whose whole life seems to circle around the battlefield. Your mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska being ran by terrorists Fox-Hound, and rescue hostages DARPA chief Donald Anderson and the president of Armstech, Kenneth Baker. On top of that, you are to find out if Fox-Hound really has the capability of launching a nuclear attack like they've threatened, and stop them if they do. This is one job you wouldn't want to take for all the copies of Radiant Silvergun in the world. The controls are fairly simple, nicely responsive, and easy to pick. The music ranges from the typical stuff you'd expect to hear to an action game, to some beautiful, almost opera-like vocal performances that are dark and astonishing. The sound is also well done, and very detailed. You (and your enemy) can hear everything: from footsteps, to tapping on the wall, to gunshots that you'd swear were the really thing, even the most jaded would be impressed here (hey... stop looking at me!). Speaking of the enemy, the AI to the game, while not all that intelligent at times (walking a course? Come on), is very interesting. They pick up on footsteps, gunshots, knocks on the wall, and even good ol' David's... I mean, Solid Snake's cold--impressive. The characters are lively and very real. I loved all the characters minus Otacon and Meryl; Otacon who I was hoping would \"accidentally\" get shot, and Meryl who, well, just felt out of place. The rest though, were amazing. Personal favorites were Sniper Wolf and Vulcan Raven who are, hands down, two of the coolest bad guys ever. There are also some cool bonus stuff to do, like the VR missions and taking pictures. You can also talk to your friends (that word being used loosely...) through Codec, which is like an ultra high-tech walkie-talkie. Occasionally the voice actors sound out of place (\"Japanese animes\"? Hello!), but that's very rarely, and the rest of the time they manage to not only avoid the trap of the Resident Evil trend, but do so with grace. Then, there's the problems of this game... The small ones would be the over-head camera, which gets annoying quickly. There are times when I'd miss an enemy, who was five feet away from me, all because the camera wouldn't give me a good view. No big. Then, there's the length of the game--it's EXTREMELY short. Scenario: I buy the so-called \"best game ever\" for ... (that's what it cost when it came out, mind you). I play game and enjoy the gameplay I do find. Metal Gear Solid is beaten in less than a day. Argh! I think you get the point... Not a major, major problem, but enough to deduct a star. But the worst problem is the story itself. Sure, it's impressive, and one of the best stories of all time (forget game of the year, call it movie of the year), but as Hideo himself said, combining a movie and a game is like combining water and oil--they just don't mix. Meryl and Snake's relationship \"mature\"? Please. By video game standards, yes. I suppose Squall's and Rinoa's was, too (I still shudder at the mere mention of those two Dawson's Creek stars...). But by the real world standards, it seems like cheesy puppy love that quickly becomes hard to swallow. That's not the problem, the problem is this: the story takes up WAY too much time of the game. And that's where everyone who's giving this a top-notch, perfect, five star rating (which seems to be everyone from Amazon reviewers to NextGen to your own ma and pa) gets confused--Metal Gear Solid is supposed to be a game, not a movie. As a movie, it's a masterpiece of epic proportions that can rival even T2. As a game, it's only fun for the few hours it actually lasts--or should I say, the hours where you're trying to stay awake through all the Codec talking. Sure, sure, you can argue that Xenogears was the same way, but A. Xenogears had a groundbreaking story, that just so happens to be the best story of all time, and B. I actually got more gameplay time out of the short and heavily texted second disk of Xenogears than I did the entire two disks of Metal Gear Solid. It gets sad when you're spending minutes upon minutes hearing about Snake talk about how he has no family when you're supposed to actually be playing the game. And while the gameplay that is here is fantastic, it's too-good story is not so surprisingly its own downfall. Just an idea, but wouldn't it be fun if we, I dunno, say, actually played a game, not a movie? Great idea, huh?

Secondly, Diablo 2 has five highly unique character classes which all play differently, and within each class are 30 skills which would take you 300 levels to explore!

The story was decent, but as far as \"engrossing\" RPGs go, it could've been a lot better.\nAlong comes Diablo II, and I hoped it resolved the problems of the first game. First off, the graphics weren't really updated. In Act 1, the monsters looked bitmapped, and the animations weren't too hot. As the game progressed, the graphics got a little better, but still, I don't play games for the graphics foremost; it's the gameplay that counts. And again, this is where the Diablo franchise stalls. I like the 5 different classes; it makes for terrific replay value. But then again, when Icewind Dale, Planscape: Torment, and Baldur's Gate I and II are out there, do you really have time to go ahead and play the same game again as a different character? The skills were pretty cool and the plot was masterfully written and detailed in breathtakinig cutscenes. But something is missing in this game. I found some of the quests tedious and boring, without any real fulfillment when I completed them. It was like, \"go here, kill this thing, and come back when you're done.\" Still, I did find myself battling hordes of demons well into the night, so it did keep my interest, simply based on the fact that I wanted to kill the big dude at the end. I worked hard to build up my barbarian, and I wanted it to be all worth it. The different locations were nice, although slightly formulaic (desert, jungle, ruins, etc.), and the ability to customize your character was a breath of fresh air. NPCs were okay, as your interaction with them was limited to mostly gossip and a few quest checkpoints. But don't get me wrong: Diablo II is a nice game, and probably worth the money. But if you're looking for a real story with a \"true\" RPG feel (a la different characters in a party format), do yourself a favor and pick up Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But if you're into tried-and-true, mindless hack-and-slash, Diablo II is your game.", "summary": "Fun...but a Little Boring", "unixReviewTime": 969926400}

Tilley Jr.", "reviewText": "First of all let me say that there is a large audience who loved the first Diablo and will undoubtedly love the sequal.  This review is targeted for the rest of you who may not have caught on to the craze or the hype.\nLike many long awaited sequals, Diablo 2 was destined to receive as much anti-hype as hype.  One of the biggest challenges Diablo 2 had to overcome was the treemendous anticipation and expectations that revolved around it.  I wasn't one of the fan's who were waiting with baited breath for the release, so I'll try to remain objective.\nOne of the nicest things about Diablo was the cool CG scenes between chapters and at the beginning of the game.  The story was well thought out and after watching the first movie I was really hyped to play.  While not a facet of the overall game, they were impressive and worth mentioning.\nAnother cool aspect of the game were the tons of weapons to choose from, especially with the barbarian who can use two weapons simultaneoulsy.  Unfortunately you can't leave things sitting on the ground like you could in the first Diablo.  gold and weapons go into your stash.  Once it's full anything you leave on the ground will disappear when you quit the game.\nDiablo 2 is entertaining, but failed to really captivate my attention to the very end.  I found the game to be unstable on my system which meets the minimum requirements, which was a constant annoyance.  It may not happen to you, but it was a contributing factor to my level of satisfaction with the game.\nOne of my biggest complaints with the game is that it seems repetitious.  The hack and slash elements are fun, but RPG's have come a long way since the first Diablo was a hit several years ago.  There is little in the way of variety.  The same monsters are colored differently, given new names, made a little tougher and we're supposed to believe it's a new monster.  Eventually even the combat, the saving grace of the game, gets old after you wade through wave after wave of monsters that are far more irritating than threatening.\nThe other big letdown is that they really haven't evolved the RPG aspect of the game since the first one.  Unlike other RPG's (which I'll get to in a moment) the hirelings and NPC's are static and almost worthless.  You can't interact with them, you can't change their weapons and all their really good for is taking some of the heat off your back until they are inevitably slaughtered.\nThe game is far more interesting in multiplayer as long as your not trying to connect to battle.net.  If you're like me, however and are barely able to meet the game's minimum requirements and aren't priveleged enough to have a cable-modem, you might as well give it up.  The lag will drive you insane.\nAll in all, Diablo 2 is a nice little distraction for a couple of days, but it is no t the best RPG or dungeon crawler on the market.  If you want a REAL RPG and not just a dungeon crawler, get one of the many fine Interplay games on the market.  Baldur's Gate 2 may be available by the time you're reading this, but you can already get Icewind Dale, Torment (which is fantastic), Baldur's Gate 1 and the expansion pack, and even the Fallout games, which may be dated but are far more entertaining than Diablo 2.", "summary": "Fun at first, but fails to captivate.", "unixReviewTime": 969321600}

I thought the storyline was fairly original, and enjoyed the fact that it isn't completely linear (the choices you make affect which races you can control along the way).\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is that although there is an interesting campaign as well as stand-alone scenarios to play, there is no random map feature.

You would find yourself in Sigil, the city of doors, deep in the center of the multi-verse known as Planescape; a place where the mere belief in something will cause its existence.  You play the role of 'The Nameless One' an immortal being with a touch of amnesia, in his search to find out about himself.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTorment utilizes the Infinity Engine made popular by Baldur's Gate, yet it seems to be geared more toward the new RPGer rather than fans of BG.  The interface is probably, the only downside to this game.  Everything is accessed through a circular right-click menu that is accessed during a paused game.  Everything from talking to your characters, changing weapons, casting a spell and using special abilities is run from this window.  It's a good idea in theory, yet it tries to do too much with too little.  The original quick buttons found in BG were a much more efficient set-up.\n\nThe game uses a slightly modified AD&D second generation rule-set.  As with the interface, the rule set has been simplified in this game.  You have no choice to your starting character.  Simply put, you are the nameless - an immortal human male, who starts as a fighter.  During the game, you have the option of changing between your starting class of a fighter and a thief or mage.  There's no dual-classing, switching to another class is like building a new character, yet switching back, you will find all your previously earned experience saved.  Your available party members are not only locked in whatever class you find them in, but are, for the most part, locked in their weapon and armor choices.\n\nWhat makes this game one of the better RPGs on the market is the story.  In your quest to discover yourself, you learn about the story and concept of the planeworlds, an interesting universe where belief is very fabric of being.  Though it introduces the player to the world, the story is very linear and you'll find yourself without much choice in the matter besides your decision to play good or evil.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIf you've played any of the Black Isle games on the Infinity Engine, you'll be very familiar with the sights and sounds of Torment.  It's a bit more zoomed in than the others, and that can lead to confusion when trying to cross long distances without the use of your mini-map.  But for being 5 years old and only 800x600 it is very artistically done.  A lot of work was put into creating a town that looks and feels like it could be the center of the universe.  Besides the obvious, the game has aged very well.\n\nSound:\n\nThe ambient music is excellently done, as well as the voice acting.  The biggest problem is in the game's EAX manipulation.  If you have this turned on, you'll be hard pressed to hear the voice-acting in any outdoor or cavernous scenes as it just blends into white-noise.  Besides that, the only annoyance comes with the apparent necessity to have your characters have a voice prompt after they do *anything*.  After you've heard one of your character announce they have stealthed for the umpteenth time, you'll be hoping to never hear it again.\n\nOverall:\n\nWhile it's a fun game, it's not quite my cup-of-tea.  Your character is immortal, you die and wake up somewhere with your inventory intact.  For the most part, you can go around with your level one thief and try to take out City Guards with no side effect.  The game is just too easy, even at the hardest settings.  Add that to the severely linear gameplay and at times it becomes a little slow.  It's your typical quest driven RPG without much in the way of side quests.  Luckily, you have a variable alignment which can change depending on your actions,  and that adds a little to the mix, but not enough.  If the story wasn't as well written, then this game would have been a flop, so pick this up as a nice interactive novel, but don't expect a second play through unless the best RPG you've played before this is FF.", "summary": "This is a good introduction to AD&D", "unixReviewTime": 1090972800}

The game uses a modified version of the Infinity Engine used in Bioware's \"Baldur's Gate\" series, also part of the family of AD&D-based CRPGs.\nThe game puts you in the role of the Nameless One, a perfect character for customization and self-discovery, which are what make this game so attractive.  The story has several elements of the standard myth, but your character is strangely post-modern and existential.  You will encounter a wide variety of settings, styles, and characters as you travel around Sigil, the city at the center of the universe, and the worlds to which it is connected.  You will have an enormouse amount of freedom to act and explore, which may sometimes have you exploring for hours off the main track of the storyline.  Because of this, Planescape: Torment may take over 100 hours to complete just for the first time.  However, with sufficient focus I am certain it could be done in half that time.\nReplay value is high, because you can play the game with a different personality, play style, and different companions.  The game may seem to have dated graphics, but the sound is still top-notch, and the game programming is robust.  Load times may be hard to stomach, but it should be easier if you follow online instructions to move the entire game from CD to hard drive or virtual CD.\nBe careful, though, this game will cause you to want to talk about its philosophical ramifications to friends who will be absolutely lost after you get absorbed into the world of Planescape.  The game is best played in really big blocks of time (8+ hours) followed by reflection about how great the game is.  I'm serious about that.\nBy all means, purchase a copy of this game and play it.  Play it like you mean it, and absorb everything the game has to offer in sound, mood, setting, and storyline.  Game designers take note: this game is what we should be making now, with today's audio and video capabilities.  Planescape: Torment has the best story of any game made to date, and it totally dominates the gameplay experience.  Thinking about this game gives me hope for the future of RPGs as interactive novels and world-as-playground games that tease the mind and excite the imagination.  This is the game that sets the bar for an entire genre.", "summary": "Model for CRPGs and epic gaming", "unixReviewTime": 1053993600}

I started out with low expectations, boy was I wrong!\nIn the game you play a scarred and unnamed immortal. Yes you read it right, I said Immortal. You can not die in this game(with a few exeptions). So you say, doesn't that take all the fun out of the game? No, it doesn't. After all, in all other games you just re-load a previous save untill you win the battle. The whole game is very plot-driven, and what a plot it is! There is alot of interaction with other characters around you, and the NPC's you can get to travel with you are very original indeed, this is definately not your standard, dwarf warrior or elf archer. There is a good amount of interaction between the NPC's in the group as well, and not just smalltalk, but also plotrelated conversations.\nAs you travel on the plot continues to thicken and you find out a good deal about yourself, and your past lives. Another interesting feature is the way that you can \"switch\" between classes(eg. mage, warrior, cleric), this make your character very versatile, and enjoyable.\nThe game is set in the city of Sigil, in the Planescape world. The planescape is not your average \"Tolkienish\" world, it is very strange and has alot of odd and different features compared to i.e. Forgotten Realms.\nThis is not a game for everyone, I have met many people that found the setting and the story \"too weird\" or \"too strange\", although if found it very enjoyable, getting away from the average fantasy universe for a time.\nThe dialogue is also some of the best I have seen in computer RPG's so far, long and detailed descriptions. Almost like having a Gamemaster in front of you instead of a computer. The graphics are somewhat gritty, but that only makes the mood stronger as the it fits the style of the game just perfect.\nI don't really like to compare Torment to other RPG's. It is difficult since it uses and entire different world and a very different gallery of persons.\nMy personal opinion is, as you propably know, that this is one of the best Computer roleplaying games out there, underline ROLEPLAY.", "summary": "Torment", "unixReviewTime": 1024185600}

Planescape: Torment is a remarkable game, with a wast array of sidequests, and where everything and everyone is somehow connected. The plot is somewhat mature, but the 3rd person perspective makes is much less graphic than games like Quake or Doom. The NPCs are very entertaining, and offer a vast array of skills and dialogue (I like the fact that the PC can initiate dialogue themselves). I like that the character's actions defined his alignment, not vice verse. I didn't like the limitations put on the main character's appearance and sex(as a female, I like to play w/ female PCs), but I didn't mind that much. I also liked that the area-affect spells didn't damage party members (as they do in the BG series). However, the first part of the game was quite confusing, and I had a tough time navigating through all the sections of the slums, and remembering where everything was (the programmers did include a handy map-marking feature which helps though). I also wish that there had been some expansion of some aspects in the game (such as the mysterious \"Lady of Pain\"), but far be it from me to complain.

I played the old Pool of Radiance game, Baldurs Gate, and Icewind Dale.  Planescape: Torment is better than them all.  But the game is not just a great D&D game.  It is a great role-playing and adventure game.  Every character trait matters.  Higher intelligence gives you access to more dialog options.  Higher wisdom allows you to accumulate memories and experience faster.  It is very rare to find a game that puts this kind of value on intellectual traits.\nAs I mentioned, the biggest strength of this game is the story. It is eerie, dark, humorous, creative, compelling, exciting, and unpredictable, all at the same time.  It gets interesting in the first scene and stays that way until the excellent ending.  It is supported with brilliantly written dialogue and elaborately painted characters.  Unlike most games, the dialog is one of the highlights of the game.  Each character that joins the main character is deep and contributes value to the story.  The story in most games is hit-or-miss.  This one was a home run.  It's too bad that there aren't more like it out there.\nThe graphics, more than two years after the game came out, still look good (although they are not cutting edge anymore).  The cinematic scenes are great, and the music is excellent too.\nIf there is a shortcoming to the game, then it is the combat system itself.  The feedback during combat isn't very good, which sometimes leaves you wondering why one of the characters is taking damage, or why your spell didn't work.  The variety of weapons and especially spells is decent, but nowhere close to the variety offered by other D&D games.  For instance, there are only two fifth level priest spells in the game.  The combat is still fun though, and there isn't an excessive amount of it.\nIf you are looking for a great story-driven, role-playing game, and not just a hack-and-slash game, then this is the game for you.", "summary": "Truly superior.

I have gotten back into the Mario Party series and used to own Mario Party 1 for my old N64 which I sadly sold, so I decided, being the collector that I am, to purchase an old N64, games, and paraphernalia.\n\nThe N64 Console I got came with the Expansion Pak (which allows you to play later games released for the N64) and the cables but no controller but you can easily purchase a retro knock-off version for only 15 extra bucks on amazon, also. I was really dreading the possibility that my new N64 would not be compatible with my Emerson HDTV, but the cables it came with included the usual AV cables that most Nintendo systems use (i.e. Gamecube and Wii). I hooked it up to my HDTV, flipped the switch, and she works like a charm.\n\nNow for some light pros and cons for the younger gamers who didn't grow up with the N64 but are used to the era of Wii/PS3/X-360:\nCons:\n- No 3D glasses come in the package, but that's okay since this predates 3D in the general population of Video Games\n- The Games come in Cartridge format, not Disc, because that was Playstation and Sega's turf at the time\n- You can't hook it up to a TV with an HDMI Cable\n- Most of the games may be pretty familiar to even casual gamers of Nintendo family games, but they also don't feature motion controllers\n- The Graphics are 64-bit, in other words, they look incredibly dated on a HDTV.\n- No Wi-Fi since it wasn't invented back in the 90s\n- You can't play NES or SNES games on it, to my knowledge\n- Remember, if you buy later games for the N64 such as Kirby 64, Paper Mario, or Mario Party 3, you will probably need the Expansion Pak because it can handle the slightly improved graphics.\n\nPros:\n- For those of you who are serious collectors of rare and old video games like me, this is a must since it was the first major Nintendo Gaming Console to feature 3D Graphics in almost all games.\n- Also, if I am correct, the games that require the N64-Memory Card are not available on the Virtual Console, and you can play games like Quest 64 or Lego Racers for the Nintendo 64 without having to worry about losing data every time you turn the console off if you have one of those.\n\nSo, to sum things up, buying an N64 if you are a casual gamer who is not too interested in gaming history is not the smartest move, but for diehard Nintendo Fans like me who want a little retro action?

What makes torment a great game is the interactions between your group members,  quests (that many of them don't even involve killing), and wonderful reflection of the planescape universe.  If action is more important for you than non-killing quest experience, if you easily get bored of long text dialogues (some of them don't have anything to do with the storyline, but very helpfull to understand the planescape universe if you had no experience with it before), then buy ice wind dale or diablo2 expansion.  Ice Wind dale involves linear story line, much less interaction with npc s, more monsters and more experience.\nWhat may be a con-pro for this game?\n1- It shows its age.  Its been about two years since the release of the game, and although it uses the same graphic engine with icewind dale and baldurs gate2, it is not advanced as they are in the graphics.  Resolution is limited to 640x480, but because it had very well designed backgrounds and character models, you don't even notice the negatives.  What makes it better than icewind dale and baldurs gate2 in graphics, in my opinion, is the way the npc s are designed.  In baldurs gate and icewind dale, if you have a thief character for example, unless you buy a different armor it looks like the rest of the thiefs in the town.  While in torment each npc that can be added to your group, has its own design and sound.  Believe me ,in baldurs, it really gets boring to hear the same voice from all mages while they are casting, while in torment your npc mages has their own voices.\n2- slowing down bug: The game has a bug that, whatever your processor speed is, under some circumstances the game really slows down. 1.1 patch reduces much of it, but still happens sometimes.\n3- POSSIBLE SPOILER! Map: Unless you reach the lower ward, you cant click on some place in the world map and go there.  You have to run through the whole sigil to reach somewhere far away, until you complete about 1/3 of the game.  It really gets boring sometimes.\n4- Loading scenes: In baldurs 2 and icewind dale, loading times are reduced.  Also in baldurs2, most of the time, entering a house does not need a load.  Torment uses the unmodified version of the bioware engine and every time the environment changes, it loads from the cd.  You may reduce the loading time by doing a full install, but there isn't an option for it in the installation screen.  You have to manually copy some files from the cd s and do some editing in ini files.  Go and check the black isle web site for that.\n5- while playing, you feel that there is a living city around you.  Npcs walk around, talk with each other, react when a fight occurs near them. Also for npc s in your group, you really feel that they have their own ideals, their own stories which are incredibly connected to your characters past.\n6- Nameless One (you): It is the only reason enough to play this game.  An amnesiac immortal, in search of his past and his mortality. As you learn more about him and how he caused the things that others called fate, it becomes harder to quit playing. Suggestion to hardcore gamers: If you want to get much more pleasure from the game, before playing it read something about planescape universe, bloodwar, sigil and lady of pain. You will catch some small details about nameless one's past and understand much better what happens to him at the end of the game (many people don't understand the purpose of the ending demo) and will have increadibly more enjoyable playing time than an average gamer has.\nPlay it as a fighter than as a mage, they are much different in playing. Whatever class you choose to play, always create a character of wis:18 and int:18, even if you are a fighter.  Torment is mostly a non-combat rpg and these attributes determine your exp level, amounts of memories you recall(and you learn much more abaout his past)and the number of dialogues that appear during the speech.  You gain attribute points as nameless one remembers his past, so a low str or con is not a problem for a fighter, also don't forget that you are already an immortal. :)\nBuy it, it is an incredible game.", "summary": "Some Advices Before Buying This Game", "unixReviewTime": 1002758400}

However, you have complete control over how \"TNO\" evolves, from his skills to his morality. This restriction allows the game to be so focused, but it can also be a turn-off for more free-wheeling gamers. Similarly, your choice of companions and the plotline are also bounded, which for me is also a strength but for others may be restrictive.\nThe game displays incredibly deep writing and thought: all of the major characters, including yourself and your companions, are complex, deep /people/ with personalities, motives, and quirks. The way your companions interact with each other -- and with others -- can be delightfully entertaining. (In exchange for less control over your party, you gain this incredibly rich set of personalities).

For anyone who hasn't played this game and is looking for a good role-playing or adventure game, I can highly recommend this game. There is little I can say that previous reviewers have not already covered, but Planescape is an excellent example of what a role-playing game should be. Even though the graphics are no longer on the cutting edge, the game itself easily stands the test of time.\nPlanescape: Torment represents a fantastic creative achievement, with a strange and twisted land that has been painstakingly fleshed-out for gamers to explore. The game world features an astonishing number of areas to explore. It is also very flexible -- there are many ways to accomplish tasks, from using force to smooth talking to magic means. You can choose to be evil, cruel, or callous. Perhaps you'd rather be benevolent, helpful, even generous. Unlike most role-playing games, you don't have a fixed class and you do not choose your own alignment. Your actions determine your alignment over time, and you can change your class at will. The result is a very rare game that gives gamers a real opportunity to role play, one where characters react to you based on what you've done in the past. And the story itself is absolutely compelling and fascinating, a story so complicated that one playing will not be enough to reveal all its subtleties.\nThis game is not as well-known as Black Isle's more popular Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, but it may actually be the best of the bunch. It should easily run on all but the very slowest computers. I can go on and on about how good this game is... how good the voice acting is, making the characters seem even more life-like... how original the game world is... but you should find out for yourself.

The \"why\" is the true meat of the game, and it's quite nice that while the developers were working so hard at tweaking the game's responses to be tailor-made to your character, they didn't forget to include a plot compelling enough to bring players back to the game day after day.\n If you haven't picked it up yet, especially if you've played the other games using the Inifinty engine, give it a shot.

I've just seen the end-game sequences today, and that means  my personal Torment has just started.  Since I've already played Fallout 2,  how will I ever find another game this good?\nHeavily scarred and  tattooed, your character, the Nameless One, awakes on a mortuary slab and  the first sound you hear is the smart mouthed floating skull, Morte, the  first of your companions on of your journey.  Morte is a floating  repository of knowledge, which is just as well since it turns out you've  died, come back to life and lost your memory ... again.  When Morte  translates the tattoos on your back, you get the first clues about the  cycle of life and death you've become trapped in.  In your search as an  amnesiac immortal to find out what's been happening to you and who is  behind it all, you get to explore and meet many of the strange denizens of  the Planes, performing quests in return for knowledge.  Some of those who  know the most about your past consent to join you - it would be great if  the party size could accommodate all of them.\nAlmost as quickly as you  realise this ain't Kansas, it becomes obvious Planescape: Torment is not  your average hack'n'slash RPG.  In fact, too much bloodshed will find you  \"mazed\" (I had to restart!) by the Lady of Pain who watches over Sigil, the  \"City of Doors\", the Plane which houses the Mortuary, and which contains  portals to many other Planes if you have the right keys.  Most  confrontations are best sorted out by words, and this may be a problem with  some players, as you have to wade through a HUUUUGE amount of text and  dialogue to resolve these encounters in a peaceful fashion.  In fact, I've  recently read that Feargus Urquhart of Black Isle Studios said the  incredible amount of dialogue that needed to be written almost killed the  guys working on it, and sometimes I thought the bizarre and esoteric nature  of some of it was going to cause my brain to self combust, but it all added  to the rich texture and complexity of the game.  It's a good idea to save  often, because it's easy to accidentally offend someone while tip-toeing  through the diplomatic minefield and suddenly find yourself in a fight to  the death with someone who shouldn't be killed.\nYou start the game either  as a Fighter, Mage or Thief, but can change professions during the game, as  you need.  However, it's important to specialise sooner or later, as there  are only so many experience points to go around.  Unlike other AD&D  games, you don't get to decide your character's alignment during character  generation - this changes according to your actions throughout your  travels.  And when you level, you get points with which you can increase  attributes, such as Strength and Wisdom, so you can start out as a pretty  mediocre Mage, and end up a mental giant, if that is your path.  Like all  AD&D games, Planescape: Torment is full of items and artefacts, often  only usable by certain professions, which can temporarily change  statistics.  As usual, you need these things most in the beginning, when  you can least afford them.\nSet in the bizarre, surrealistic world of the  Planes, designing Planescape: Torment must have been an experience.  How  many times have we played games supposedly set in an alternate reality, but  where the buildings look eerily similar to ours?  The external architecture  of Planescape: Torment's buildings, many of which served no apparent  purpose, looks like something Gaudi could have designed had he been on  crack!  The interiors, however, are usually disappointingly familiar.  Some  of the spells, and there are many, are worth learning and casting just to  see the effects!  Members of your party have their own little  idiosyncrasies (Annah's tail-flicking, Morte's eye-rolling, and Dak'kon  constantly sipping from his flask) and like to chat or argue among  themselves - which can be disconcerting just when you're about to wade into  battle!\nAlthough Planescape: Torment uses the same engine as Baldur's  Gate, the \"camera\" is closer to the ground, thus making the characters and  their immediate environment quite detailed.  However, this makes everything  very close, so ranged weapons are useless and by the time some spells are  cast, the foes are beating the @$#%^ out of you (some can't be negotiated  with!), or with some of the area spells, you get hurt as much as the enemy.  You have to learn very quickly what works.  The music score, although  sometimes tedious after many hours, contains some great themes -  Deionarra's theme in particular is so hauntingly beautiful it was worth  visiting her just to hear it.  The voice cast, containing some reasonably  well known actors, is largely wasted since, except for a few introductory  phrases, most dialogue is text.  However, among others, you will hear  Michael T. Weiss (The Pretender), Mitch Pileggi (X Files), Dan  Castellanetta (Simpsons), John DeLance (\"Q\" in Star Trek: TNG) and who knew  this is what Sheena Easton has been getting up to lately.\nI must admit  that when I first read about Planescape: Torment and read the box, I  thought it would be too \"dark\" and bizarre for me.  Then I thought these  other people awarding 5 stars can't all be wrong, so thank goodness I  changed my mind.  Even so, it was several hours before I \"got  it\".  Apparently, due to the reason stated above, while not ruling out  the possibility, the guys at Black Isle are in no particular hurry to get  started on a sequel.  I hope they recover soon and get started, because I'm  already waiting.\nIn its latest issue, my favourite gaming magazine here  in Australia listed Planescape: Torment as the second best game ever,  beaten only by Deus Ex.  For me, even though it's like comparing apples and  oranges, it's a dead heat for first place - Fallout 2 and Planescape:  Torment (but then, I haven't played Deus Ex!)", "summary": "You MUST play this game!", "unixReviewTime": 966902400}

It uses the TSR D&D rules (although instead of having your stats  rolled out for you it assigned a certain number of points you have to  spend) and many of the creatures that inhabit the D&D world.\nYou play  the Nameless One, a man who dies and comes back to life over and over  again.  You have bo idea who you are or what you're doing, and have nothing  to guide you except a note tattooed on your back telling you to go visit a  man named Pharod.  From there you're plunged into a great long adventure  all about finding out who you are and how you came to be what you  are.\nThe perspective is akin to Baldur's gate and Diablo, although unlike  those games there are no multiplayer capabilities.  You still are able to  pick up companions in the game such as Morte the floating talking skull,  Annah the red haired half-demon woman with a rat's tail, Ignus the fire  elemental, and many others.  All of them have their own skills and their  own personalities.

My first assumption was that Planescape would be a  knock-off of Baldur's Gate, and be fun but not unique.\nIt is, amazingly,  far more than that.\nSure, it's built on the same great engine that  Baldur's Gate was. Same third person view, with the great graphics and  sounds that BG is famous for. However, the developers of Planescape  definitely knew what they were doing when they enhanced the system. They  addressed many complaints gamers had with BG, and took it to another level.\nTake death. Yes, that pesky death stuff that seems to happen to gamers  when they encounter a group of basilisks or perhaps a bandit or three. No  problem for Planescape - you're immortal! Not only that, but deaths  actually help you sometimes, jarring loose memories that were until that  point hidden. Like who you are. What you're about. Why you're immortal when  apparently nobody else is.\nWhich brings me to another point - the  storyline is great! They take an idea that has definitely been done before  - you wake up with amnesia, uncertain of your past or present. Nine Princes  of Amber is a famous story that does this very well. So you learn as you  go, with the help of your amusing sidekick, the skull named Morte. Yes,  your pal is a floating skull who follows you along :)\nThe game is  understandably \"dark\". You are, after all, someone who keeps  rising from the grave, wandering around a miserable little town full of  unhappy people. It's probably not a game for 6 year olds, but most  teenagers will easily relate to the misery of the town's occupants. You  find things like clot charms to help heal your wounds, bandages to tape  yourself back up. It's the same quests and challenges, but it's so much  more ...\nYour alignment actually alters as you interact with NPCs. Keep  doing good things - your alignment is naturally good. Keep slaughtering  innocents while they plead for mercy, and yup, you're bad. Your alignment  then affects how people react to you. Even better - your intelligence  determines what you can say or do in some cases!  No more of this idiotic  barbarian easily figuring out how to deal with a noble negotiator.\nI was  impressed!\nThere are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through. You wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back. You  wander outside and find a note-zombie, with notes stuck to his body. Every  doorway can be a portal to another world, if you find the key. But keys can  be anything - a piece of paper, a certain person, even a song sung in a  certain way.\nThe game is definitely a thinking game - one created for  true strategists and role players, who want a challenge out of a game and  not just a hack-fest. For gamers who have complained that RP could never be  fun on a computer, try Planescape Torment.

What I was confronted with was a game rich in storyline and graphic detail, but on the playability end as  compared to the other RPG's released by Interplay, I knew issues were at  hand.  The game runs slow sometimes even if you have a super PC and the  patch is virtually a must if you want fully enjoy the game.\nFirst and  foremost, I am a huge fan of Bioware.  I think they have done wonders for  both PC RPG's and  also bringing AD&D to the computer.  But, After I  was a few hours into the game, I was hit with the cold similarity that  Planescape Torment was very easily compared to the Fallout series.  It  seemed to me strongly that the Planescape Torment setting was awfully close  to the Fallout games.  I'm not too much into conspiracies, but I'll put my  money on it that this game was a result of a dropped project to make  Fallout 3 using the Baldur's Gate Engine.  The graphics, the screen font,  the dark settings, they all fit Fallout.  This was a bummer to me, and I  almost felt like I was playing a thrown together project saved by a team of  fans from the Planescape setting.\nBut, I can't let that ruin the game.  It is a very intelligent game, and certainly not one for kids in terms of  understanding and content.  The dialogue and intrigue are very intense and  do make you part of the game and your character, much more than almost any  game I've played before.  That is not an easy feat for a PC game.\nMy  final analysis is that this may not be a game for fans of Baldur's Gate or  Fallout, and with the later fans you will absolutely see what I'm saying  when comparing Planescape to the post-apocalyse setting.  That is where my  fifth star dissapeared to.  All in all, this is an excellent roleplaying  game, but not for all RPG fans.  This is a thinking game, not a combat  game.

Let me begin by saying that N64 is not bad at all... N64 has a much better processor because it has 64-bits of power (PSX only has 32), 3 times faster than PSX, 4MB ram but with Expansion Pack it goes up to 8MB of ram (PSX only has 2MB ram) and features a higher resolution than the PSX.  This is how the N64 is more powerful than the PSX.  This is not to say that PSX is a bad system.  One downfall to N64 is that it runs on cartridges.  The N64 cartridges may store a lot more than all the other cartridge-based systems but it holds less than a CD and DVD.  It can hold a max of 500MB while the PSX can hold up to 700MB.  This is the weakest point of the N64.  However, with more system ram, it can improve the already good graphics and make a game longer.  Another thing is that most PSX owners will say that N64 can't have FMV (Full motion videos) in the games.  This is NOT ture.  If you own Resident Evil 2, then you will know  what I am talking about.  The only problem is that the FMV is a little less clear.  Since N64 runs on cartridges, it takes longer for developers to make.  So there are only around 300 N64 games while there are around 600 PSX games.  But with rare on Nintendo's side, who needs as many games.  All in all, Nintendo 64 is the best system (besides GAMECUBE, PS2 and X-Box)... It beats PSX to the ground on everything except the Game format.  If N64 were on CD's, PSX would have died a long time ago.", "summary": "Be careful - some systems just seem good in stores!", "unixReviewTime": 1010016000}

Sure the n64 has better graphics, but playstation was the better games and better sound. In my opinion nintendo aims their games for a much younger audience. Many of their games are not apealing to the 14+ crowd. Playstation provides way more games for this age group, along with games for the younger group, but they can still be injoyable for the older gamers. The playstaion controler is much better in design. The dual shock controller is the best that i have seen, but who wants to put that bulky heavy rumble pack in the back of the n64 controller? I hate the memory pack for n64, one season on qb club fills the whole thing, theres 20 bucks gone for a game that costs 60 in the first place. That brings me to another point, games are alot cheaper pn playstation, you are looking at a 20 dollar diference. If you are deciding between a playstation or a n64 i would go with the playstation.

I can see how some people would criticize it, calling it  mediocre, because of it's old look and feel. However, in my opinion, older  games are the best, and I'm so glad that Novalogic have gone back to basics  almost, swapping revolution for a great gaming experience.

This has to be one of the best rendered games I have come across. The gameplay is simple enough to grasp, there is not much of a learning curve here. Sound,despite the odd shrill female voiceover, is very well done. So why do I rate a mere three stars? I have one rule to playing games. I play for fun and not to be aggravated. Unfortunately Tachyon has a few elements that are sure to tick some (certainly me) off. The game is played out on the \"Job Board\" where you will be hired to complete contracts ranging from deliveries to disabling \"Capital Ships\". Some of these quests require the player to repeat multiple times before figuring out how to find the proverbial chink in the armour. Try disabling a Battle Cruiser that outguns you 20-1. Good Luck. That (repetition) gets boring real quick. Each time one has to return to base, rearm and take off again, usually passing through multiple gates before reaching the target. That is a whole lot of lost gaming time. The thrill of the chase and intensity of combat (assisted by the A1 graphics) makes up for the lag. But my biggest complaint is that I have encountered difficulties with the docking controls. On a few occasions I have had to spend up to an hour just trying to dock (despite the autodock feature) because the AI wouldn't acknowledge that I was there. Indeed I had to abandon one quest (Rescue the Persephone) because the auto dock didn't work. It's not just a thing that makes you go ,HUh! but is also very annoying. The quests simply lack the depth and sophistication (lasting little more than 10 min. on average) to overcome the deficiencies.

I read some of the other reviews below and heard about how this game isn't compatible with some graphics cards or whatever. If that were the case, I'd haved to give this game one star. But since this game did run perfectly well on my machine, here's what I have to say about it. The only space sim that I've played other than Tachyon is X-Wing--an old VGA game--but in many ways X-Wing was the turning point in space sims. The graphics in Tachyon are really good, if somewhat redundant. What I mean is that sometimes I see the same patterns and textures on space stations. Speaking of space stations, I was MOST IMPRESSED by their SIZE. The people at Novalogic really did an outstanding job at scaling things correctly. But what really got me to buy this game was the fact that you could buy different ships and decide what armament and upgrades you want to put on it. Certain ships have a certain amount of slots, and the possible combinations are nearly endless. Another nice feature is that you can own multiple ships at once, or sell individual ships or parts for money. You can hire wingmen to assist you on missions. Since there is no in-flight camera, it's hard to tell if your wingmen did anything to help you, but at least they don't die easily--even the poorer pilots. There are several external view, but I didn't find them very helpful. They should have put a gunsight on the external view so that you could fly through the mission, accomplish it, and enjoy the scenery at the same time. The game is sorta nonlinear. You get to choose which level mission you want to undertake, but ultimately you will end up doing the others. The missions are fairly simple and varied, which is nice. I remember that X-Wing was downright frustrating at times. By the way, there are cheats for this game, so if you get stuck, look 'em up. The levels with the fog are interesting, although they can be a strain on the eyes and disorientating at times. But that's not until the end. There are some cut-scenes, but nothing truly original or amazing--they're still the in-game graphics. This game could have been better, but overall I'd say it's worth its price.

Remember if you will (or just pretend if you never played the game) Wing Commander 3.  One ship, the Arrow, a light interceptor, had an ability called the Slide which enhanced it's dogfighting abilities.  Well, EVERY ship in this game can do that.  There's more though... There is a ship add-on called lateral thrusters in the game, which allow youer ship to strafe side to side.  Basically, with both of these aspects being redilly available to every ship in the multiplayer campaigns you have 'dogfights' turning into odd forays which much resemble 'circle strafing' matches in any number of First Person Shooter style games.

Aside from the fact that it gracefully and heroically retires Christopher Blair (Mark Hammil) from the series, the  game is an expertly crafted piece of entertaining with only a few  (stylistic) flaws. It also improves greatly over Wing Commander IV: The  Price of Freedom by making combat missions longer than the video cut  scenes, something that dogged its predecessor greatly. Prophecy has such  eerie underpinnings that work together with the game and live action  cinematics to make for an awesome story. It is also the start of a new  generation.\n After the defeat of the Kilrathi by Blair in Wing  Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, the Confederation finally has peace with  regards to their once feline adversaries and the Cult of Sivar. But there  in lies the crux of the matter for an ages old Kilrathi prophecy points to  a time when darkness will descend upon the universe and the Kilrathi will  die, bathed in their own blood and their once mighty claws no match for the  coming evil, a time that they call Kn'Thrak, (A translation that means  either `darkness' or `evil'). And it all begins with the destruction of a  Confederation survey ship analyzing the destroyed Kilrathi homeworld in the  Kilrah System by an unknown race.\nThere Shall Come A time\nWhen one who  has the heart of a Kilrathi,\nbut is not Kilrathi born, shall  rain\ncleansing fire down upon us,\nand Kn'Thrak, a time of great  darkness,\nshall embrace us.\n We are then taken to the TCS Midway, a  gargantuan super carrier that will be the focus of the game and your home  base for the duration. It is truly a magnificent ship and about the same  size as Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer-about 8,000 meters in length. It  acts as a mobile base for the Terran Confederation and designed to be the  center piece of a larger armada. It is here that we meet Lance Casey-your  character-who is fresh from the academy and son of a famous TCN pilot. We  also meet up with old Wing Commander alumnus-Maniac (Tom Wilson) who takes  every opportunity to belittle Casey until getting his comeuppance in the  worst way and by numerous members of the Midway's crew.\n Basically  it's your job to figure out just who these new aliens are and what they  want. What they apparently want is to slaughter everyone and everything  they come across, which is great because that's why you're here! There are  heaps of missions here and they are all a great deal of fun. Missions range  from standard Combat Air Patrols (CAPs), to seeking out and destroying  capital ships, taking down freighters and search and rescue missions. One  of the most memorable moments of the game is a missile launch, especially  the Swarms, which leave twisting contrails as they streak off towards their  targets. Origin really did a fine job on the new fighter designs-they no  longer have the blocky, slab-like look that Price of Freedom had, but  instead have a more graceful, rounded look. Most of these ships are also a  joy to fly, conveying a great sense of speed and maneuverability, though  less so with bombers like the Devastator.\n Sid Mead (of 2010 &  Blade Runner fame) was hired on to design the alien Nephilim/Phylum  fighters and capital ships, and produces true wonders! The fighters have a  beautiful aquatic-insectile look to them while the capital class starships  resemble nothing most people have ever seen. They are both fearsome and  invoke no small amount of curiosity from the player and made me want to  find out more about this dark and enigmatic race.\n Mission designs  seems to have been a priority at Origin, because they are expertly crafted  and bear much resemblance to Freespace 2, and lack the time-sensitive  nature that plagued many of the X-Wing & TIE Fighter missions from  LucasArts. I also retract my title comment in my Freespace 2 review-Wing  Commander: Prophecy is as good a game. The missions take priority over the  cut scenes, the post flight ones become annoyingly repetitive, as there are  only 2 or 3 to see and you see them often. Beyond that this is Origin's  swan song as there doesn't seem to be any movement from them to sequel it  beyond Secret Ops which only adds new missions, good as they are. This is a  fantastic game-it both looks and plays great while possessing a solid and  engrossing story.

It soon became apparent that enough money to enable purchase of the really cool stuff is hard to come by, especially if you want to keep your weapons and armour in good shape.  Even if you tote about all you can carry, it doesn't raise much when you get to a shop.  Also, one of the areas is practically impossible to negotiate without ranged weapons, which are prohibitively expensive, and you don't find many on corpses or in chests.  The warrior has no magic skills at all and is dependent on food and potions for healing and curing.  You can only carry a limited amount at once and you always seem to run out at critical moments.\nI left my warrior in the castle and started out again as a conjurer, as I'd read in some reviews that this is the most diverse and interesting character to play.  Well, I haven't played as a wizard, and probably won't, but playing the conjurer is great fun.  You visit the same places, but have quite different challenges and meet different people.  A conjurer can use bows, crossbows and staves, can wear leather armour (some you find in the latter stages are pretty cool) and has heaps of offensive, defensive and healing magic at his disposal.  The most interesting spell enables you to charm animals to assist you and later you can even summon them to help.  Your great mid-game foe, the mimic, is a worthy ally when summoned, especially against the vampire lichs.  In one of Nox's great ironies, monsters in the conjurer game drop heaps of ranged weapons that a warrior would kill for, but which are useless to the conjurer and raise hardly any cash.  I'd advise not to buy arrows, as you find more than enough in the latter stages and you can use the cash for better purposes.  And carry a few spare sets of armour into the final chapter, as you'll go through it quickly and any armour is better than none.\nNox has often been compared with Diablo, and while I can see why that comparison can be drawn, I would liken it more to Revenant.  Like Revenant, it has a good story line, very impressive graphics, and a very simple control system.  But it leaves both Diablo and Revenant floundering in its wake, since it has a pleasing amount of gameplay, acceptable voice acting, challenging (but not impossible) puzzles, and a satisfactory ending.  I wasn't having much success in the final showdown, so I restored and tried a different approach (always take note of your latest find - it's often a clue to defeating your next foe).  That time Hecubah could not withstand the concerted attack, and after a great little final cut scene, Jack (and the TV) were restored to Earth.\nI'd read that Nox is very fast, and boy, was that an understatement.  Battles in this game, particularly in the latter stages, needs amazing reflexes, something I'm not overly endowed with.  However, I am blessed with cunning and persistence, and after my character died three or four (or even ten) times, I'd managed to figure out the puzzle, or a good strategy against the monster(s).  Some of the later monsters move with lightning speed, often only needing one hit to splatter Jack and his gear all over the screen, so a well-positioned charmed or summoned ally makes an excellent distraction, allowing Jack the nanosecond needed to get off a good shot or spell (I didn't have much success with bombs).\nI loved Nox, but since I've revised my personal scoring system, I can only give it 4 stars.  I'm saving 5 for that really unforgettable game, and although Nox was great fun, it really was too similar to Diablo and Revenant to outscore them.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2001", "summary": "Fast, funny, and heaps of fun!", "unixReviewTime": 980985600}

Atfirst glance, this game seems like a rip-off of many other games outthere. Diablo or Baldur's Gate, anyone?\nWhat original ideas. You can be a warrior, conjurer or wizard. You come from Earth, you're sent into another dimension where you are the Only Hope. Even worse, you're a male from a Florida trailer park whose idea of fun is crushing beer cans against his forehead while rebuilding truck engines. Let's talk about the anti-good-gaming ideal.\nHowever, when you start up the game, the graphics amaze you. The whole sparkling mouse, the smooth graphics on all the select screens, and then the game play graphics. Simply amazing. Barrels are not just background decoration, they are all discreet individual objects.  Rocks, skulls, you name it - all individual objects that can be moved around.\nThe enemies all have personalities. The three factions all have distinct reasons for existing, and are in conflict with each other. The comments are humorous and the individuals have personality. I suppose at times the coders can overcome even the most inane marketers when it comes to game design.\nThe spells are great!  The conjurer, my favorite character type, has a Pixie Swarm to help defend him, and can have various creatures hang out with him as sort of a roving company of friends. I like the wolves and spiders myself, but you can acquire just about any enemy out there to hang out with you and help protect you.\nThe training levels are easy to get the hang of. I dislike the cone-of-vision, because even if you were just in a room, you suddenly forget where everything is in it - even the walls - and have to visit again to make sure you didn't miss anything. If you swing by a room, it draws it as a complete room, so it's difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed by.\nAlso, save games are limited and you can't describe them at all. They simply list the character name and actual time - making it quite difficult for a multi-gamer household like mine to keep characters separated!\nThere are other minor bugs - icons don't consistantly draw in, and multi-player bugs are slightly annoying. The game itself is WAY too short when played in single player mode. Multi-player gets old really quickly, as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again. How about cooperative quests, like in BG?\nIn general though, the graphics and gameplay on this game are quite better than I had expected from a game that touted male-only characters. If only they had put a bit of effort into thinking about the people playing this game, and what they would want to play! I would have rated this game extremely highly, instead of only reasonably high.

It is certainly been worth it! All the delta force games take place out doors which makes them different. It's realistic action were you have to snipe your way around the perimeter to make your way into a camp to complete your mission objective. Of the three delta force games i own i think df2 has the most original and interesting missions.\nYou like missions? Well in this game you get over 40 of them! I wish rainbow six would give you that many. These missions are part of two campaigns that form a certain story line or you can play them as \"quick missions\" in any order on your own. Many of those missions are also available in multiplayer so you can play coop with a buddy. The missions take place in a variety of weather conditions day and night and the challenge is being able to take out all the terrorists because that one guy you missed will take you out and remember one shot kills! Sure you can respawn but that just means starting the mission all over again from the beginning. That is the challenge in delta force the sheer number of combatants you need to take out and the large area in which they use. For example in one of my favorite missions there is a downed pilot hiding in this snowy wilderness. To fly him out safely you need to take out a camp containing at least 25 of the enemy and destroy three SAMs. Getting most of the terrorist scum is easy as you just take a position up top and start picking them off but it's hard to get them all and some are out where you can't see them easily. So patience is key because as soon as you leave your cover somebody will get you. It took me a while to complete that mission and twice i was 99% finished just having blown up the SAMs only to get sniped.\nYou don't have a huge number of weapons to choose from but what you have is fantastic and you'll find yourself using one of the sniper rifles or the M4 machine gun which has a grenade launcher. You won't use your hand gun much and you have the choice of delayed or frag grenades. Satchels are available for blowing up large things like those SAM sites and you can use extra ammo or a vest as one of your options. Because methodical, longer range warfare is the order you have a really nice alternative to games like rainbow and half life were most of your action is confined to a small space. It's the pace of the game that i really like and it's a blast to pick off some terrorist from 300 meters away.\nThe multiplayer is a whole new ball game because you're going to have quite a few people trying to get you. The last time i played at nova world there were 900 people in there so you never have to wait for some action. You can play deathmatch where every man is for himself or team death match. Capture the flag is a blast. You really can never tire of this game!\nDrawbacks? Well the graphics are not an improvement over delta force one though they are pretty cool. You do need to update the game all the way because there are a few problems that needed to be fixed and you'll want to maximize your resolution. The game can be just a bit choopy and sluggish at times which brings me to why i only have a 4* rating.\nIn all the delta force games you are placed in an outdoor enviroment that is enormous. Often you will have to run for a minute or two just to engage the enemy or reach their camp. In all these games you feel like you are spending too much time running  around and that is especially a problem in multiplyer were you run for ever only to get killed and have to go back to where you were . DF3-landwarrior remedies this problem a little by making the characters run faster but in this game you seem to plod along at a slow pace. That's especially true when running up and down steep mountains.\nOver all delta force2 is a fantastic realistic shooter with unique characteristics. It's a great compliment to some of the other great games out there. I own rainbow 6 and rouge spear and this makes a nice alternative. Certainly the price is right.\n[....]", "summary": "I like this game......", "unixReviewTime": 1024099200}

Excellent graphics, new features such as GPS navigation, more airports worldwide, better weather system, and easier to  use. There is a downside to all this I think the consumer should know. The  speed of the game is NOTICABLY slower compared with MS FlightSim 98 and  below... Very glitchy all-around. I could not seem to speed it up (usually  averages around 20 frames per sec) even with setting the detail settings  lower. To put it in perspective, I have a PII 400mhz computer with 192mb of  ram and a 16mb 3dfx Voodoo 3d accelerator card. I even bought the  accelerator card to see if it would speed it up... it barely does! I am  recommending anyone who wants to buy this program and likes a fast,  non-glitchy game to be aware that if your computer has a processor below  300mhz, you will not like what you see... Microsoft says that you must have  a 166mhz minimum! HA! You wouldn't even be able to fly the graphics would  be so slow.\nTo recap, If you want the game to run smoothly, you should  atleast have a 300mhz PII system with atleast 32mb of ram and I would  recommend getting some kind of video accelerator card (if you don't already  have one, and if your serious about performance).  If you just want to  play and don't really care about the slow speed, go with Microsoft's  recommendation about having a 166mhz processor system or higher. It will be  very slow but will work.\nOverall, this is a very good game and would  recommend for anyone!

In v1.2 it wanted to reload without ever  shooting.  Soldier AI has been greatly improved on both sides as well.  However, the dead bodies still just hang in mid-air if shot on slanted  terrain.  Mouse sensitivity has been improved also.\nI'm awaiting the new  Devil's Bridge add-on coming around the end of the month which will take  the campaigns to locales like Greece, Poland and Battle of the Buldge.

Age of Empires II - The Age of Kings stands the test of time.

The gameplay, immersion in detail, and strategic fun in Age of Empires II makes it into a game that I envision will be playable and fun for years to come.\n\nThe game takes you through a variety of situations. You need to be an efficient hunter-gatherer. You have to know how to manage naval warfare. It's a great test of your ability to think outside the box, as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every pass.\n\nI adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting.\n\nI realize that some people aren't interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy. However, those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat. The game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle. I happen to love the multiplayer aspect here.\n\nYes, the graphics aren't super high def and up to current standards. That is quite all right by me. The gameplay itself is well done, and really after a few minutes I don't even notice what the details of the various structures look like. I am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses. As long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with, that's all that matters to me.\n\nAre there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here.

I played it for over a year, then came back and played it for another year. It's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. Not Mario, not Zelda, not the great Doom, not Quake or Half-life or Warcraft or even Grand Theft Auto has ever had me as hooked as this game. Microsoft and Ensemble Studios hit the nail on the head with AOE 2.\n\nThe sequel to Age Of Empires keeps everything that made the first one great, throws away almost everything that made it bad, and throws an amazing, revamped user interface that gives the player god-like power if used expertly.\n\nThe different civilizations are fantastic. The advantages and disadvantages of each one make the game interesting and balanced, although some civilizations are better (overall) than others. I mean, really, who doesn't love (and equally hate) the Longbowmen? The War Elephants? The Woad Raiders? The Throwing Axeman?\n\nThe units are the best part of the game. Except for the paladin and scorpion wipeout trick, the unit balance is superb. The naval battles are amazing, with fireships, ballista ships, and even ships that launch cannonballs.\n\nThere are more buildings, tons more upgrades, and a brand-new unit I like to call the x-factor: the trebuchet. This is one of the units that makes AOE 2 a true delight. As built up as a city can become, it can be destroyed in minutes with enough trebuchets.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of this game is what solidifies AOE 2's standing as one of the best games ever made. It is surreal. I've had 12-hour multiplayer sessions many times. You just don't want to stop. It's so fun!!! It's madness!\n\nAs far as challenge goes, you'll get all you want. Just try beating the entire game on the hardest difficulty and see the headache you get. And if you get through with that, buy the expansion pack and eat your heart out.\n\nBuy this game! Play it until you're sick of it! That probably won't happen, but even if it does, when you come back from your break you'll be twice as hooked.\n\nHa!!! The memories I have of this game!

Yet it is never tedious, you really get a feeling that you are actually building up an empire- your empire for your subjects. And every single individual unit is fully and believably animated. A major advantage of Age of Kings over the earlier Age of Empires is that you can order your fighting units into set formations like squares and lines, instead of just sending a mob into battle. The interface here is unbelievable- the \"giant\" map actually has the feel of a huge extent of territory- enough for a kingdom or an empire.

As you probably know, in the first Age of Empires, you could only build one unit at a time per building, and the \"Rise of Rome\" expansion only allowed you to build multiple units of the same type. The Age of Kings allows you to que multiple units of different types, up to a maximum of 15 at a time.\nThe units are also able to move much easier. As it was easy in the first version to block and trap your own units with buildings, The Age of Kings makes sure that your units can always find a way through.\nThere are also features that allow you to set the stance and actions of your units. For example, you can set units to guard another unit, to patrol, and to follow an enemy unit at long range. You can also set to aggressive, defensive, stand ground, and no attack stance.\nThe units, and especially the villagers, work and move much faster, which I have found as a huge plus.\nThe graphics are much better, more detailed, and the motions of the units are better.\nThis game is like RollerCoaster Tycoon, SimCity, and Command and Conquer all rolled into one.

The buildings on AE II are much more life-size and intricate in detail.  They are also more varied than the first & include Cathedrals and Castles.\nAmong the new features is your ability to garrison your townspeople in buildings & towers to get them out of harms way.  Instead of being all men (like the first one), this one also includes female townspeople as well as Joan of Arc.  Also new is the ability to create several types of military units at the same time using the same barracks / stable / archery range, etc.  In the old version, you could make several units of one kind, but not several units of different kinds.  A helpful  aspect, to say the least.  Another nice characteristic of the game is that you can actually upgrade scouts to light calvery.  That means that you can have military units on horseback (that don't cost any gold) which are actually semi-decent in combat (not so with AE I).\nThis is a must-buy game for anyone who even casually enjoyed AE I.

And the historically accurate missions follow the lives, trials and battles of William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Ghengas Khan, Barbarosa, and Saladin. While these campaigns are somewhat static and \"rail,\" they are engrossing and interesting.\nAll 13 civilzations are wonderfully balanced. Unique units for each are an especially nice touch. And the ages that you advance through provide a new element of strategy (for instance, you will never even consider attacking with the Turks in the early stages because of their advantange in the later stages; likewise, the Britons and Persians are ideal for a quick win because of their advantages in earlier ages. Once you advance with them, you'll find that they don't have the \"strength\" needed to pull ahead, though I have devised numerous strategies for the Britions that will allow victory in the late ages).\nOverall, one of the best games ever.

In this type of game, you get to pick any one of the 14 different civilizations to be, all of which have unique strengths and weaknesses.

It makes it extremely easy to  control the formation and behaviour of your troops, and queing units is a  snap.\nThe second strength is the AI, which (along with Dark Reign) is the  most complex in any game to-date. The AI will respond to attacks on its own  bases, and it will send large strike forces against your armies.\nHowever, AOE2's greatest weakness is its lack of a cohesive  single-player campaign. Instead of a series of missions linked with a  cohesive storyline, you have several separate campaigns, each centering  around a different empire. So the missions are more like skirmishes than  really cohesive campaigns. Regrettably, Starcraft is still the king when it  comes to single-player campaigns.\nFor the above stated reason, I must  remove one star.

My computers are not old either, one is a 300p-2  160megs ram 17 inch monitor, voodoo3 etc. The other is a 450 amd k6-2 96  megs ram, Ati graphics, 15 inch monitor.

More than enough!  Let's talk about the very first one, on the original Playstation.  This game is a fantastic first-person shooter *and* a great World War II game.  You get the best of both worlds with Medal of Honor.\n\nI'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to first-person shooters, I am absolutely *horrible* at them.  Enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere ALL the time and cheap-shot me, and then, of course, I die very quickly.  With most games like this, you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before it's quickly \"game over\".  With Medal of Honor I can FINALLY put those nightmare problems to rest.  I can actually complete about 50% of this game, which, by my standards, is a BIG pat on the back.  I never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible (and be able to complete some levels) but it's true!  Here's why:\n\n- The buttons are laid out *perfectly* on the Playstation controller.  The target button is really easy to use.  You can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy.  It never fails. The shoot button works great.  The jump and duck buttons work great.  EVERYTHING works great!  When you aim at something before shooting, it actually works.  It's amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined.  The play control is a major improvement compared to Syphon Filter, for example.  In that game, it felt like I was awkwardly walking or sliding all over the place.\n\n- The challenge in Medal of Honor is perfect for people who are NOT professionals when it comes to first-person shooters.  The challenge in each level builds and builds, very slowly, allowing you to learn and master the controls while you make progress.  Syphon Filter fails to do this.  So does Metal Gear Solid.  Medal of Honor is an easy-to-understand shooting game for people who normally aren't very good at these kind of games.  I really want to thank DreamWorks (the company responsible for this game) for making the challenge just right.\n\nAlso, you encounter just a few cutscenes here and there, and each one is very interesting to watch because they show you what it was like during World War II, and you may even learn some stuff about the war that you've never known before.  Good cutscenes.\n\nThe objectives you have to complete are always pretty fun, and not too difficult (until later in the game).  When I say \"not too difficult\" I mean, not too difficult to understand *and* not too difficult to complete.  Whenever you want to find out what you have to do, just press the Start button and your short and simple objectives will be given to you right there.\n\nAs a shooting game, Medal of Honor shines and easily surpasses most first-person shooters once again.  Enemies are everywhere, and many of them want you dead immediately.  Luckily, they give you enough time to react.  When you arrive to a harder level later on... well, keep in mind that you will have to keep playing certain levels over and over, and learn where each and every enemy is located, and take them out as quickly and effectively as you can.  Trust me, this is really fun.  It's *so* much fun to find out which gun you're carrying is most effective on the enemy you encounter.  You will probably lose a bunch of times while you learn, but this is all part of the fun.  Making it to the end of a level *doesn't* require luck like in Syphon Filter, and you will feel satisfied once you've completed a stage.  You can even play the completed stages over and over again, if you want.  Medal of Honor is so good, why not play the same stages over a hundred times?\n\nI don't know what else to say.  I love this game.  Oh yeah, the music and sound effects!  The music is like listening to a suspenseful, realistic war movie.  It's really good.  The sound effects are awesome as well because each soldier you encounter has something interesting and different to say.  You will be amazed at how many new lines these soliders can come up with!  You will hear the sound of silence while walking around in the dark, along with the sound of distant gunshots and other creepy sounds.  All this adds up to a disturbingly, realistic wartime experience.\n\nOh, and the animations you will see from enemies falling over after they've been shot is *clearly* a notch above the rest.  Even after killing these guys a million times, they seem to find new ways to amaze me with their ability to squirm around and struggle to survive.  Simply put, you will *always* see soldiers do different things before they die. Sometimes they shoot wildly all over the place while falling over and dying.  Other times they will fall to their knees before falling over for good.  Wherever you shoot on their body, they will react very realistically.  Shoot them in the foot they hop around.  These are probably normal and understandable things that a human being would do if they were dying.\n\nThe weapons are what you'd expect in a wartime game.  Very good weapons, and very easy to aim and use them on an enemy.  No problems here.\n\nI haven't encountered any blood in the game yet, but, as far as I'm concerned, blood is overrated because the color red is just that- a color.  It means nothing to the actual gameplay.\n\nSome very minor problems I had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly, which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger, and the graphics are slightly dark and dated.  Just slightly.  Don't forget the occasional Playstation glitches.  Also, there are actually loading times in the game.  It takes 10-15 seconds to load a stage.  I thought by 1999, loading times were a thing of the past.  Despite these problems, Medal of Honor is still a near-perfect game.\n\nOverall, please buy this awesome first-person shooter.  Today, in 2007, first-person shooters and war games (specifically World War II games) are all OVER the place to the point where it's almost boring to play one anymore.  This is because war time games are a genre that has lost its appeal over the years, thanks to overexposure and repeating more or less the same required-strategies with each new game that gets released.  In other words, all war games are basically the same thing these days.  It's boring.  But guess what?  Back in 1999, when Medal of Honor was brand new, the Playstation didn't have a whole lot of games like this, and war games were treated with more respect, which make Medal of Honor all the more special.

You hardly notice that once you get into it. The sound is what truly shines in this game. Everything from germans yelling to one another to shotgun fire to explosions. Control is deadon, no complaints there. The gameplay is engaging and intense and, at times, difficult but extremely fun nonetheless.\nI give the highest honor to this game.

MOH features excellent looking explosions, beautifully designed levels, and great detail on the bodies. The overall look of MOH is breathtaking, you'd think with that much action on one screen you would experience slowdown, but that isn't the case in Medal of Honor. I've been playing the game non-stop and haven't noticed a touch of slowdown. Overall crisp visuals, great looking explosions and flawless frame rate, make MOH of the most enjoyable game too look at.\n  The game's main stand is it's unbelievable gameplay. Playing this game almost makes you feel like you are literally in the war. It's main idea is to re-live WWII all over again, you are a US Soldier who is the best in his class who was hired by an agency and is out to carry missions. On your missions you will encounter German Nazis that need a little lesson, teach them one and keep going. Every stage has at least 3 or more missions to be completed and on some you will need to use your noodle a little. Since this title's main focus is the realism, EA has decided to include an array of weapons. Everything from a regular handgun to a shotgun and even to a rocket launcher. Besides having tons of weapons to choose from you also can take control over an enemy's machine gun. You may notice these powerful machine guns in almost every stage implanted into the ground. You can take over them by pressing Square and shot the enemies.\n  Now that we have got the weapons out of our hands, I can now talk about tactics. First of I want to mention that the Artificial Intelience is incredibly smart, so you won't be dealing with idiots that don't even run away from grenades. No way, if you throw a grenade at the enemy he will either pick it up and throw it back at you or he will kick it away. In terms of gameplay this game can truly be compared to GoldenEye. It's AI is far more intelligent than that found in GoldenEye, MOH features a more extensive line of weapons than GoldenEye and the game (MOH) has a better balance. Medal of Honor actually features a good story line, and the cameras aren't bouncy. There is more to be said, but in the end Medal of Honor leaves Nintendo's GoldenEye in the dust.\n  Here comes the greatest aspect, it's revolutionary sound. Playing Medal of Honor will definitely make you feel like you are in a movie theater watching some action flick, say something like Star Wars EP1. The game's sound effects are truly mesmerizing, every shatter, every footstep, every gun shot can be heard, and the clarity is to die for. If you have a big screen TV, and a powerful stereo system make sure to hook both up and play Medal of Honor, because I swear to you if you pump up the volume you WILL be experiencing World War 2. And last but not least the game also features dialogue during in and out of the mission.\n  On the control side the game, it isn't really disappointing but control takes time to get used to. This is a 1st person shooter and their are controls to be learned. The top shoulder buttons (L1, R1) are for moving sideways, L2 is to crawl, R2 is to aim, L3 is to center view, X is to shoot, Square is to open up doors or take over machine guns, Triangle is to Jump, and O is to switch weapons. The lay out may sound easy but it takes some time to get used to.\n  In conclusion Medal of Honor is one of Playstation's best titles out there to date, and it is very well the best 1st person on the market. Mixing, the story of Saving Private Ryan, and the action of GoldenEye, Medal of Honor is truly one of the years best games ever. Even if you are not a fan of 1st person shooters, I still highly suggest buying Medal of Honor.\n9.2 / 10", "summary": "psx best first person shooter and one of the best on the psx", "unixReviewTime": 1007769600}

You have over 50 WCW wrestlers at your disposal, the ability to take the fight backstage to one of twelve different areas, ring entrances for each wrestler, a choice of six different types of match, a smattering of weapons lying about such as bats, chairs, and - my favorite - tasers, the ability to wrestle (in all of the historical rings from  important WCW events) in exhibition and pay per view matches as well as go in quest of titles leading up to the coveted heavyweight championship belt, and the option to create your own wrestler.  Another important aspect of the game is the color commentary provided by Tony Schiavone and Bobby the Brain Heenan.  It doesn't take long for some of these plusses to start feeling like minuses, however.\nI am not a big fan of the new manner of controlling your wrestler built into this game; it is much less intuitive than older WCW-based wrestling games, and I often find myself able to come up with only a very limited number of moves; still worse, I constantly find myself repeating moves I had no intention of repeating.  The announcers do at least have fun with this, talking about move repetition in disparaging terms as it is going on.  Their overall banter, though, while quite funny at times becomes repetitive itself after a short while.  Even the overexcited shouts of Schiavone declaring a victory in the ring grow stale, as do his constant calls for someone to stop the bloodbath and call for help.  I never get tired of the Brain, though; he is always hilarious.\nI don't think the graphics here are much of an improvement over older games, either.  There's really not a lot of difference in audio and visual between WCW Mayhem and earlier WCW games for the Playstation.  You can fight backstage now, which is cool, but the graphics are largely unimproved and the gameplay is awkward and sometimes annoying.  I would much rather play the older WCW/NOW Thunder than I would WCW Mayhem, when it comes right down to it.", "summary": "Awkward controls make for limited mayhem", "unixReviewTime": 1064102400}

The best part is that you can actually for the first time (in the WCW games) listen to the theme music before you made your guy (given up in WWF Smackdown) and they last longer than 5 seconds.\nThe only real problem here is the create a wrestler, it's preety shallow and the move list is that of where you must pick another guys moves (I generally used either Sting, Goldberg, Nash, or Chris Benoit) and stick with that.\nI guess the real reason I love this game so much is the fact that it holds the best Theme Music to date.  My favorite theme Music (even though I am not a WCW fan) is the four horsemen.

This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game).\nIf you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time.\nYou will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game.\nIt is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then.\nI have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all.\nIf you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you.

In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect.

In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble.\n\nThe N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own.\n\nNote that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED).

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.\n\nThe game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.\n\nThe cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.\n\nFirst and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.\n\nSecond is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.\n\nLast some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.\n\nAnyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.", "summary": "Great concept but equally flawed game....", "unixReviewTime": 1218585600}

There are many different skin types and different skin makers, so you have to judge each on it's own merit. My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller. I will definitly be ordering a few more later, a friend has a birthday coming up.", "summary": "Xbox 360 Controller Skin, Black Silicone", "unixReviewTime": 1326931200}

Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.\n\nOverall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing.\n\nThis memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance.\n\n(One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.)\n\nOther than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2)\n\nOverall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person. But for the price, you can't beat it.", "summary": "A memory card that surpasses the original...", "unixReviewTime": 1384560000}

The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game.\n\nExcept somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.\n\nCertainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness.\nBut Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology.\nSo how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game.\n\"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes.\nThe graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed.\nThe graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2.\nThe default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them.\nOn this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter.\nI recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.

Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom!\n\nGameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version.\n\nSound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade!\n\nGraphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS!\n\nCharacters: You get a line up of the following characters:\n1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\")\n\n2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\")\n\n3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.)\n\n4.

Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\")\n\n8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.)\n\n9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.)\n\n10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.)\n\nOver-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.\n\nMost people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.\n\nThe thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.\n\nAs for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel.

I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.

Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review.\n\nFirst off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.\n\nIn Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected.\n\nThere aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver.\n\nI told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman.\n\nI also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality.\n\nWhat more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.", "summary": "Banjo Kazooie", "unixReviewTime": 1283212800}

But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.\n\nGames of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.\n\nThe game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.\n\nAnother way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.\n\nBut the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.\n\nGraphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times.\n\nOne of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool.\n\nMario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.\n\nGameplay: 9.5\nGraphics: 8.5\nSound: 9.5\nCamera & Control: 8.5\nValue: 9.5\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9.2/10", "summary": "Banjo-Kazooie didn't revolutionize the platformer, but it reminds us of why we like the genre so much in the first place", "unixReviewTime": 1233964800}

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\n\nSound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant.

The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.\n\nFun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on.

Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo.

Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.", "summary": "Hit the power and prepare to be impressed.", "unixReviewTime": 1053388800}

Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation.\nI am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody.\nThe controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic.\nThe story goes...\nThe evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game.\nWell, I hope you enjoy this game. Thanks for reading this review, and until next time...\nCRIMSON|RED", "summary": "For gamers young, and old...", "unixReviewTime": 1040601600}

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is. I'd buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this. Now I have a Playstation 2, and I still have my Nintendo 64, but only play two games on it; this, of course, and Super Smash Brothers.

But then I realized \"oh yeah there's more to this, isn't there?\" And that's when the fun started.\nGraphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that \"wow factor\", like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.\nSound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying \"Hey!\" and an occasional \"Hello\" from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music. One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play, such as Song of Storms, Zelda's Lullaby and Song of Time, plus general area music. Although the overworld music isn't like what it was on Link to the Past, it's still great.\nStory: The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman. Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there. Even though it can be a quite simple story, it's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.\nGameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour.

I've always been more of a Playstation one fanatic, but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played.  If you think that Final Fantasy is good, then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk.  There's only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked, and that was Gauntlet Legends, Super Mario, and Donkey Kong.  But this game beats them all by a longshot.\n  Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five?  The reason is because of the...problems listed below.\n  1.  This game is HARD. I don't mean hard as in \"Challenging\" I'm talkin' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard.  The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.\n  2.  There are a couple of glitches in the game. Example: I dare you to cut a sign with your sword.  Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time.  The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float.  That's just one of the glitches.\n  3.  A little confusing, as far as the story goes.  It's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.\n  4.  Replay value isn't very high.  Once you complete it, that's it.  It's so hard that I wouldn't ever want to go through the same frustration again, as to the fact that it was very difficult, even if you do know what you're doing.\n  Okay, those were the bads.  Here are the goods.\n  1.  The graphics are outstanding.  Wow.  The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth, only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.\n  2.  Once you beat the game, you feel satisfied with yourself.  Sure, this game is a little short, but it will still take you a long time to beat it, no matter how experienced you are with gaming.\n  3. The plot is good and twists a lot.  I know that I said it was kind of confusing, and it kind of is, but it's still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.\nIt's sort of a mystery.\n  4.  Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences.  It's true.  Like I said above, the graphics are wonderful.

The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it.\nWhat makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.\nMuch of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal.\nThe gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).\nIn brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.", "summary": "May Very Well Be The Finest Video Game Ever Released.", "unixReviewTime": 1018051200}

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser.  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man.  Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.\nAs with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game.  They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part.  There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with.  Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots.  The controls are wonderfully intuitive.  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.\nThe Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it.  You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential.  In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task.  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.\nAs I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game.  They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier.  One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows!  Later in the game, you will be glad you did.  Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars.  They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game.  Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword.  Don't say I didn't warn you...\nAlthough you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one.  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule.  These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.\nAll in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect.  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!

You pick from lots of different species and skins! There is different cool kinds of gameplay in it! There is Tournament Deathmatch, Tournament Team Deathmatch, Domination, Assision, Capture The Flag, or Last Man Standing, all have like at least 10 different maps to play. Tournament Deathmatch, Tournament Team Deathmatch, and Last Man Standing is all the same maps. Tournament Deathmatch-Basically, blow anyone up that is standing! Tournament Team Deathmatch-You play 4 teams, Green, Blue, Red, and Gold, blow up the other team! Domination-You have to teams, Red and Blue, and you try to get 3 different places, and if you get 1 plus what ever you put deaths on, you win. Asission- Two teams, one defending a base, or a object, one trying to destory it. If you can do it, then the other team gets the same time as you, and face off. -Capter the flag, two teams, red and blue and trying to get the other team's flag, but it's hard because it's way back in the other base, try to survive, almost imposible. So many points of getting the flag to your base, and you win! Last Man Standing-you get every weapon but two, and try to kill each other, you get a certain number of lives that you choose. You also get 200 live!\nAll that plus 13 different weapons!\n~Chainsaw-You only get this if you check, \"Chainsaw Melee\" and you can rip other peoples head off!\n~Translocater-You need to check \"Translocater\" to get this, you basically teleport, and if you teleport really close to someone, you can kill them by, \"Telefraggin' them!\n~Impact Hammer-No ammo, you always have this, if you go by someone with this, you can shoot guts everywhere!\n~Enforcer-Like a hand gun, you start out with this gun and 30 ammo.\n~Biosluge Gun-You take a gun, and use toxic sluge to kill people, warning, it can kill you too!\n~ASMD Shock Rifle-You use a eletrick shock rifle to kill people!\n~Pulse Gun-Like ASMD Shock Rifle, but more shooting, more ammo, and it's green not blue shooting.\n~Ripper-A gun take shoots razor blades out!\n~Minigun-A gun that is very weak, but shoots out like 50 bullets in 2 seconds!\n~Flak Cannon-Lots of little, or one big yellow shock ball hits you, does huge damage.\n~Rocket Loncher-Shot out lots of rocket with this rocket loncher!\n~Sniper Rifle-Get a closer view on this!

I know I have. So what do you get, out of the box, when you invest in UT? Its a winner, I tell you that right away. Lets see ... 10 cool weapons, each  with two attack modes to keep it all a tad more interesting than just point  and shoot. You may actually end up developing something resembling a  personal style with these. Especially interesting is the Translocator,  which in addition to being a nice transportation device allows you to beam  yourself right into your opponents carcasseseffectively ripping them  asunder, of course. Clean me up Scotty!\nIf you aren't all that crazy  about online games, UT does live up to its claim of being a killer  single-player experience: the bots, boring as they look (except for the  very goth Necris, I think), will keep you entertained and on your toes. The  AI is purty adroit: true, bots don't play like human players, but these  digital playpals get close. They use all weapons and gadgets very  efficiently, go everywhere you go (no cozy endless sniping here), and I  SWEAR that during one Capture-the-Flag game I was ambushed by one waiting  right outside my home base as I rushed after the enemy flag bearer, who had  cleverly activated his personal shield specifically for this maneuver.  Doh!\nIf you do get bored, you can still tweak just about every aspect  of the game from individual bot intelligence, behavior and weapons  preferences to special mutators for the matches (Want sniper rifles only?  No problem). UT boasts 50 maps, a lot of which are simply breathtakingIll  never forget the first time I was standing on the dizzying height of a  space station tower with Jupiter filling the sky and its moons wheeling  around above my head. You may even catch the occasional shooting star (no,  reallyjust before that nasty sniper feels that youve been standing in one  place long enough). Imagine fighting on board a spaceship zipping through  hyperspace ... or a galleon on moonlit seas ... or in an Egyptian tomb ....  whoa dude!\nUT adds two new game concepts to the traditional menu: in  Domination you and your team (the bots, by the way, are very responsive  during team play, too) need to hold a number of designated control points  as long as possible in order to win, and in Assault you actually have a  number ofnaturally destructivemission objectives to fulfil  (e.g. storm  the facility, take out gizmo A to get to gizmo B and blow that up too),  after which the tables turn and your team takes the defending side.\nOh,  and one thing (and my only Quake III - UT comparison): the bots in UT talk  their acknowledgements, comments, and taunts, and they're pretty  nastyquite unlike the witty and urbane remarks of the Quake bots you see  printed on the screen. You might get provoked into anger and violence,  burning to shove their smart  quips back down their throats.

So I guess this would be part one of my Metal Gear Solid retrospective series. I haven't ever really gotten into the old 8-bit games which might make me a bad fan but for me this is where this series starts.\n\nAlright, this game was somewhat of a game changer both for video games, and myself.\nThe view, the level of story telling. Couple this with my original introduction to this game which was a PSM disc that was being given out with Pizza Hut orders in my local village.\nThe disc contained demos for a few other games however the two games of serious note were Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Metal Gear Solid.\nMGS featured a Japanese voice track and you played through the infiltration of the basement through the above airfield and into one of the two ducts. Then the demo ends.\nNeedless to say I was hopelessly interested. I had never seen a game like this before and what I had only experienced was the tip of the iceberg. I couldn't have ever known how much further down the rabbit hole this game would take me.\n\nAllow me to interlude a moment,\nAlthough I had an NES, Sega Genesis, SNES and at some point in my very young years an Atari. I would have never been what a person could call a gamer. Not until the advent of this title did I commit time and energy to a game that I could have been using for something else which is, by my own personal criteria, the definition of a gamer.\n\nAlthough as of the time of this writing this game shows it's age. Graphics are pixelated at best, character animation are a bit shoddy. However, what this game still has in spades is an epic story, the gameplay is a bit linear compared to modern games, however I defy a first timer to tell me the procure on site, and survival aspects of this game aren't thrilling.\nStory aspects of this game and the voice actors inhabiting their roles is especially satisfying even to this day.\n\nSo the game itself has a tendency to be a bit clunky, people used to pressure sensitive controls will be frustrated at the fact that you can't simply tilt the left thumbstick slightly to walk silent. Instead this is accomplished by lightly tapping the D-pad. That's right, this game requires the use of the D-pad.\nThey, once upon a time, made PS controllers that didn't feature thumbsticks and/or vibration. This game was released during the advent of the original Dual Shock controller so while there is a vibration feature, the game it's self doesn't utilize the sticks in any other way besides as the left stick functioning as another D-pad with no pressure sensitivity.\nAiming is accomplished through holding the SQUARE button, some weapons default to a first person view while others maintain their top-down aspect and Snake simply pivots in place and auto-locks onto the target nearest.\nInventory system is simple and functional. Your bottom right shoulder button (R2) controls weapon inventory where you will rotate to the item you want and then release the button to equip it. A quick press will unequip or quickly equip the item once pressed again.\nOn the left side the L2 follows suit however these are items like rations, for health and binoculars.\n\nEnemy AI can be a bit punishing. Genome soldiers will follow footprints left in the snow or water to your location. They will seek out strange noises and if and when you are discovered you will be instantly surrounded by his cohorts and more than likely pummeled by assault rifle fire until dead.\nThe AI isn't really that smart, point in fact, the game makes Snakes inability to sneak more or less what makes the AI appear so intelligent.\n\nYou traverse the game on foot and can and will need to revisit locations. Although you are on a base on an island this game has an open world feel because you have free reign to go anywhere you please once you have the sufficient items necessary to get to the locales. Along the way security will increase and a sharper wit and tactic will be required for back tracking especially in the higher difficulty settings.\n\nBoss fights are interesting and non-repetitive. You will never defeat two bosses the same way. You'll encounter tanks, helicopters, gas mask wearing S&M telepaths and the way you over come each will test your intelligence and break the fourth wall a few times.\n\nThe game moves relatively quickly, depending on your skill at the gameplay and your patience for long talking scenes. The codec system is filled with hours of useless expository and sometimes nonsensical conversations that allows you to delve a little deeper into the back story. These codec conversations are actually the nucleus for the entirety of the Metal Gear saga. I hear tell of 55 minute speed runs but I've never seen or come close to accomplishing such a thing myself.\nMost plot points are driven from here. So if you are consumed with needing to know why something happened in MGS 3, chances are the answer is somewhere in the sound files on your disc for the codec conversation. Everything is fulfilling and entertaining and well voice acted. Although repeat play throughs probably won't benefit from the listens but I do suggest for people wanting an innumerable amount of backstory on the overall series to give all convos a listen at least once it's been 18 years and on my most recent play through for the buildup to Phantom Pain I was still finding new things, or maybe just things I had forgotten. I guess I'm getting a little old.\n\nThe game wraps up with one of two endings and without spoiling or giving anything away it depends on if you save or allow a character to die. dependent on which circumstance the game ends on you will receive some special equipment of which can be used in an, ahead of it's time, enhanced play through where you will have all gear you collected in the first play through. Snake is quite a dapper fellow in a tuxedo, just to give you an idea.\n\nAll in all the game is satisfying, thrilling and features a storyline worthy of any 80s action saga which is the feel they were going for there. More to the point I think they were really trying for an Escape From New York feel and I think they accomplished that without it feeling like a rip off but it certainly has the same spirit.\nYour villains are as interesting as the protagonist and the games grand scope of ideas. It's perhaps to cinematic for people who aren't fans of long drawn out story.\nAlso this game is not a shoot-em-up action game. The idea of the game is to get by without the enemies ever knowing you were there and you are given some pretty interesting tools to accomplish this.\n\nIf you have not played this game I would strongly suggest doing so for fans of the stealth genre of games. This isn't where it started but it's definitely where it got it's legs to stand on and certainly what popularized it.\n\n**Thanks for reading, I'm not sure how I will be going through the games, I do plan to review all for Amazon but I don't know if I will do them chronologically or in the order of release. Just keep an eye on it if you are interested in reading the other ones.", "summary": "Metal Gear Retrospective: Part 1", "unixReviewTime": 1468540800}

Even after all these years the orignal Metal Gear Solid balanced gameplay and story make it my favorite of the series however it now looks best on playstation vita (you need to download to ps3 in bubble form to put on vita).\n\nMetal Gear Solid VR Missions: is MGS 1 VR missions greatly expanded upon its not bad if you want more MGS 1 gameplay but do note the best VR missions are already on MGS itself still nice to play if your a huge fan of MGS 1.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: The game play in this game is completely revamped to make the game look more realistic along with its graphics being greatly upgraded to also make the game more realistic however the characters are often disliked (especially Raiden) and the story is mostly conspiracy and gibberish most people either love or hate this game. Not all the info needed to draw accurate conclusions of what happens in the game are provided within the game some appear later in the franchise,so the entire game is left open to speculation on what actually happens.  The story was orignally intended to end the franchise with eye opening thought provoking ending but it tries to convey too much all at once. So your left trying to make sense of real life themes, games plot points and other references all thrown together into a melding pot which make up the ending of this game.  Even if you think the game is gibberish the VR Missions are an improvement over the first games and are a fun distraction.\n\nTwin Snakes: If you liked the gameplay in MGS 2 better than the first game then i would highly reccomend this MGS 1 remake playable on gamecube and backwards compatible wii's(white wii's). The story on this one is slightly expanded and has MGS 2 gameplay mechanics and graphics so a real treat if you wanted another game like MGS 2.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 3:Widely Considered to be one of the best if not the best game in the series. Game play now revamped its now more about sneaking around outside with survival elements thrown in and it is considerable upgrade in game play and story compared to MGS 2 however if you loved MGS 2 you may find these changes to be less of a good thing.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Peace Walker: Gameplay very similiar to MGS 3 but with the concept of Mother Base added this is a base that you must find personnel for and is used to develop weapons and other various tasks which you must manage in between missions. Easily one of the best games in the series personally i enjoyed it more than 3.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Gameplay adds in out door urban gameplay and the return of Raiden (note: games chronological order doesn't coincide with the number of the releases). This Game Finishes up the Solid Snake Story line from MGS1&2 and is the 4th best selling game on ps3 (the only platform it was released on).\n\nMetal Gear Solid 5: Metal Gear Solid 5 has the return of the mother base concept expanded upon and accessible during missions from Peace Walker. This Game is made to be more of an experience and a challenge more so than a story driven game its also the longest game and features the return of MGS online for strategeic multiplayer fun. Gameplay is truly top notch in this one and this is one of series highlights.", "summary": "Metal Gear Solid Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1448755200}

This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:\n\n1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.\n\n2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the \"easy\" setting either.  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter.  Very, very annoying.\n\nand lastly,\n\n3)  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL, but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS3.  The controller port switching doesn't work at all, and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him.  You'll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this.  I don't understand why this happens, but after performing a search for the issue online, it's clearly well documented.  I don't know why they haven't fixed it.\n\nIn any case, the game deserves 5 stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it, but the above concerns are worthy of a 1-star deduction.", "summary": "Great Start to a Fine Series", "unixReviewTime": 1440720000}

Voice acting in the game is impeccable and character models are quite decent considering the age of the game. Lots of unique ways to approach an enemy and very creative solutions to puzzles. There are just so many good things you can say about this game. The controls are good, music is amazing, the environments are detailed and open, the enemy AI is advanced, items and weapons are varied, etc.\n\nThe series is most known for its interesting and outlandish boss fights. Every fight in the game is handled in a different way. Some require a straight forward approach, while others need to be handled long distance, while others still need you to interact outside of the game. The boss designs are fun and different. No two characters are a like. They all have very distinct backgrounds and attributes.\n\nThere aren't any cutscenes per se in this game (FMV which was popular at the time. Most exposition is handled via codec conversations with limited animation and text. These can get a little lengthy and may require familiarizing yourself with the games support characters to remind yourself what to do next.\n\nWhile the game is very good in a lot of ways there are two things that hold it back a little:\n\n1. There is a lot of backtracking in the game. Perhaps there was an area that was blocked off before or an item that you need to proceed, you will then learn that you need to go back 3 locations to find what you need to progress in the game. That can get annoying at times.\n\n2. The game tends to get a little bogged down in the political story and you can be listening to a conversation for a very very long time. This will be the biggest flaw in this series following this game. Lots of talking and watching, interrupting your gameplay. Not necessarily the worst thing, but sometimes you just want to blow something up.\n\nVery good game for the era and still very playable. Has decent replay value with unlockables and easter eggs to be found. Will play in your PS3, so you don't even need to pick up a used playstation 1.

It stars Solid Snake, a weary, gruff veteran of the battlefield with a deep, gravelly voice, who always keeps a pack of cigarettes handy just in case. His mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility on an island off the coast of Alaska, code-named \"Shadow Moses,\" which is currently being occupied by the ex-black ops unit turned terrorist group known as \"Foxhound.\" It's not immediately apparent what the group's ultimate goal is, and in fact one of the great pleasures of \"MGS\" is the way in which the story slowly unravels. Many of the characters have secrets and motivations of their own, some of which wisely go unexplained (what's Ocelot really up to?). As a game made on PS1 hardware, the gameplay holds up considerably well for its time. It's played from a third-person top-down perspective. You can equip different gear (rations, binoculars) on the lower left of the screen and weapons (guns, explosives) on the lower right. Stealth plays a big role as you constantly try to avoid alerting the patrolling guards. The best gameplay sequences involve the unique boss battles with the members of \"Foxhound.\" These sections are fun because no boss or battle is alike, and each character that you duel feels wholly original. The main draw and what makes this game, and the series, so special is the masterful storytelling that grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. It's the stellar voice cast, including David Hayter as Snake, the ingenious plot, the phenomenal soundtrack and atmosphere - it's the meticulously crafted world that you can't help being completely absorbed in.\n\n--- 5 STARS ---", "summary": "A classic and a masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000}

It was originally a classic on the MSX2 computer in Japan, but the series became really good when it debuted on the PlayStation. Developed and published by Konami with Hideo Kojima being the director and producer, this was the first game in the series to become very popular. The games ground breaking graphics, addicting gameplay, challenging stealth action and its amazing storyline heavily influenced games that would later produce well detailed story lines. It was originally released on PlayStation, but would be re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic, a remake on the GameCube and there was even a port on Game Boy Color which apparently got good reviews (I find that hard to believe, Ill have to check that out some day).\n\nThe storyline is the most complex and most detailed of any video game that was released at that point. There are tons of cut scenes, character dialogues and we didn't see a game like this back then. The story takes place in 2005, about six years after the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake and 10 years after the events of the first Metal Gear. A genetically enhanced Special Forces unit called FOXHOUND has invaded a nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses island in Alaskas Fox Archipelago. The forces demand that the U.S. government turn over the remains of Big Boss within 24 hours or they will launch a nuclear weapon. Big Boss was the main antagonist in the first two Metal Gear games who is one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived. The terrorists want the body so they can take his genes and put them inside the soldiers so they can become an army of super soldiers and take over the world. The main hero Solid Snake is forced out of retirement and is sent to go to the island and stop the threat. I won't say anything else about the story because my reviews are always spoiler free, you have to play the game to see it for yourself.\n\nLike with Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on Nintendo 64, Metal Gear Solid was making a leap into the third dimension and the graphics for their time were very well detailed and the game has aged pretty well. Details such as seeing the characters breath in the cold, very high draw distance, seeing smoke from cigarettes or footprints in the snow is all in this game. The gameplay is very similar to the 2D Metal Gear games on the MSX2 computer. The game is all about sneaking by without detection rather than a straight on shooter, but there are moments where you do go in all guns blazing, but its mostly a sneaking mission because going in guns blazing makes the game much harder. I like stealth games like this because it makes us cautious and can even be scary at times because everything is quiet and suddenly a security camera or guard spots you, the alarm goes off and you're slightly startled and have to hide and hope they don't find you.\n\nThe most innovative feature in the game is the radar which shows the terrain and your enemys field of vision. Its very useful and youll see yourself looking at it all the time. But in some areas, the radar gets jammed and you won't be able to use the radar if you are spotted so you shouldnt get too used to it. Ways to get by undetected include crawling under objects, hiding in boxes, hiding behind walls and making noise to distract the enemy. The game also includes many gadgets and items such as infra-red goggles, night vision goggles, mine detectors, rations, binoculars, the famous cardboard box andcigarettes?\nThe weapons include hand to hand, you can choke your enemies to death, use a standard pistol with a silencer, grenades, C4, machine gun, proximity mines, a remote controlled missile launcher, a sniper rifle and even a Stinger missile launcher which uses heat seekers to follow your target.\n\nThe boss battles are very epic and every one of them has a strategy to defeat and its always best to use your radio to contact your support crew for tips on how to defeat them. The radio is also used to provide info about the games back story and even the controls.\nThe game also features a training mode called VR Mode where you can practice hiding techniques, weapon use and sneaking. This is one of the best games on the original PlayStation and the only flaw I see with this game is that you cant aim in first person view mode which can make it difficult to shoot some of the enemies. But other than that, the game is practically flawless, it has great graphics, is challenging and one of the most detailed story lines of all time. It is simply a masterpiece and a must play for any kind of gamer.\n\nFINAL RATING: 10 out of 10", "summary": "The start of stealth action", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800}

I didn't even know about this game until I downloaded the demo!  I haven't been exposed to \"The Hype,\" so my review is going to be completely unbaised.  So, what do I think of this game?\nIn  many aspects, simply vanilla.\nI don't care what engine a 3D game use, as  long as I enjoy the game.  Just as the realistic gore and fun seperated  Soldier of Fortune from the rest, Daikatana's storyline set it apart.  Plus, in Daikatana, you can \"level-up\" and alter your stats as  you kill more enemies.  You can increase your weaon's damage, speed, your  jumping height, maximum health, and your running speed.\nThe weapons are  innovative, to say the least, with 6 unique weapons in each of the four  episodes. along with the Daikatana itself.  When you use the Daikatana at  first, it's a slow as crap.  But as you kill more enemies with it, the  sword becomes more powerful, until it reaches level 5, at which point a  flick of the wrist can kill anything.  The downside to this is that YOU  don't get level-ups.  Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an  omelette, I guess.\nAlso, the locales are especially unique.  You travel  through four time periods, and in each one, there is unique architecture  that really sets the mood of the level, from the icy lands of 560 A.D.  Norway to the temples of ancient Rome. Unfortunately, those are the ONLY  things that set Daikatana apart.  The rest of the game is the usual  \"find key/switch/artifact, open a door, repeat\" formula.\nNow,  for the BAD part of the review - the AI!  In the game, you'll get two  sidekicks that help you.  A few levels later though, you'll want to call  them \"groinkicks,\" because they will impede your progress so much  that you'll want to give them just that!  The sidekicks get in the way of  your aim, they shoot YOU when you get in THEIR aim, they fall off ledges to  their deaths, and they'll go after an enemy, even if they have no weapons!  And guess what?  If they die, so do you!  Most of the time, you'll order  them to stay put and finish the level yourself.  And the enemies?  They're  cannon fodder.  No brains at all.  With the exception of the civilians, all  they do is rush you.  Believe it or not, the smartest enemies are...the  doors!  I'd swear that they have the minds of sadistic killers!  They just  LOVE to ambush hapless heros - they stay open until either you or a  sidekick walks through the doorway, and then they suddenly close, crushing  all that are in the way!  Enemies know well enough to avoid them, so I  guess in a certain respect, they ARE smart!\nOverall, as I mentioned  before, Daikatana is vanilla.  There are new innovations, but when you get  down to the gameplay, it's more of the same thing.", "summary": "A review unbaised by \"The Hype.\"", "unixReviewTime": 959731200}

Some are good, few are great, many are mediocre.  Almost none live up to the standard that this game has created.  I played this game for the first time this year, and it beats out everything else I've played  - I just can't put it down!  I am only about 5 hours in and haven't even reached the 2nd disc yet, but I feel I've played enough to give a fair judgement of the game and its mechanics.\n\nI downloaded this game from PSN to my PSP, and even without a controller this game controls quite well, save for the shooting.  Using the PSP's control nub is kind of inaccurate when attempting to fine-tune shots.  The game features many control options to choose from.\n\nThe story revolves around Snake, a secret agent who is trying to stop his former military unit from launching a nuclear weapon.  The plot unfolds mainly through cutscenes and codec conversations...lots of them.  However, I feel that the plot was interesting enough to make up for what may be a bit too much exposition.\n\nGameplay revolves around stealth.  Although there are guns, it is to your advantage to take out enemies quietly and one at a time - or avoid them altogether.  You can go in guns blazing, strangle each enemy one by one, or hide from enemies all together - that is the beauty of this game.  You are given many tools and gadgets to get the job done, but it is up to you to figure out how to proceed.  Unlike many games today with only one right way to proceed, there are many possible strategies to use to make it through the terrorist base.  There are also plenty of boss fights (which in my opinion are the best part of the game) which are all varied and interesting, as well as challenging.\n\nIn short, MGS is simply a game you can't miss.  If you go into the game yearning for something different from the typical action shooters of today, you should be in for a treat.\n\nPROS:\n-Interesting story\n-Unique, innovative, strategic gameplay\n-Challening, fun boss fights\n-Great voice acting and music\n-Decent length, for the price and age of the game\n\nCONS:\n-Perhaps a bit too much exposition\n-Story can be hard to keep up with at times", "summary": "Legendary", "unixReviewTime": 1324598400}

Not a huge one, as  people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good.

It was considered so original, it influenced many, many stealth-type games that followed it. Too many.\n\nWhere do I start with the things I hate about this game?\n\n1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing \"Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!\" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. \"Easy\" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what \"Hard\" mode was like.\n\n2. Way too many cutscenes! I've never seen anything like it. There's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes. This has got to be the talkiest video game I've ever played.  And these dialogues are all so silly, and you're pretty much forced to watch them or you won't be able to understand what's going on. In fact, I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes. It's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.\n\n3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, \"Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!\"\n\n4.  Even more excusably, there's not way to pause the cutscenes.  You can't even pause the codec dialogues!\n\n5.  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didn't, the scene would be too easy.\n\n6.  There are far too many boss monsters.  It's like every other encounter is a boss monster.  The first part of the game (say, up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot) is pretty great, but that's not representative of the game:  after that it's basically an unending series of boss monsters.\n\n7.  Frustratingly, you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die.  Having to \"kill\" the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you're going in circles.\n\n8.  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down. Was this written by a 14-year-old?\n\n9.  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time:  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didn't mean to do this.  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still, allowing your enemies to shoot you.  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.\n\n10.  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.\n\n11.  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices, such as the thermal goggles.\n\n12.  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you:  you can't look ahead because your radar is \"jammed\" and then you get shot by a security camera.  Or blown up by a mine.\n\n13.  The way you are prevented, after having killed a boss, from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didn't collect during the battle.  Is it there or not?  So why can't I get it now?\n\n14.  The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game's finale.", "summary": "was this meant to be a satire of video games?", "unixReviewTime": 1276992000}

Now, ten years later, I manage to get my hands on a used copy here at Amazon (I spent about $12.00+4.00 S&H).

You play as Solid Snake (who is perhaps one of the most famous PlayStation game characters if not one of the most famous game characters of all time), who is sent to Shadow Moses Island in Alaska to neutralize a terrorist threat (pretty standard action movie stuff). But, the story will continue to throw various plot twists that may seem random at first, but add up in the end (I'm avoiding the main plot elements just so I don't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played the game yet). 10/10.\n\n  Graphics: For its time, this game had amazing graphics. The only PS1 games I can think of that had better graphics than this game would be the Syphon Filter series. 9/10.\n\n  Sound: Crisp sound effects (for it's time), wonderfully composed musical score, and outstanding voice acting (David Hayter was especially good). 9.3/10.\n\n  Gameplay: I have played through many games since my first experience with MGS 10 years ago (I've played through roughly 200 games throughout my lifetime. Yeah, I know, I'm a loser with no life), and this game still captivates me. If a game made a decade ago still manages to provide engaging gameplay after all these many years, that is a fantastic accomplishment. 10/10.\n\n  But, most importantly, this game delivers a few good messages. Examples would include the threat nuclear warfare possesses on the world as well as the meaning of life. Sadly, most gamers do not take these messages in and just sees MGS as simply a game. MGS is more than a game, it is perhaps the first game to ever attempt a movie-like feel and succeed. I hope this game, as well as its creators (Konami, Hideo Kojima, and Yoji Shinkawa) will go down in history as important figures in the gaming industry.\n\n  All I can say is that this game deserves at least 9.0/10 overall. With that said, I cannot understand why Jeff Gerstmann decided to give it a score lower than that. I consider this one of the best games I've ever played, and is even better than some of the newer games I've played (Gears of War and CoD4 have nothing on this game). This game is even better than MGS2 (even though MGS2 is a fantastic game in its own right, I give MGS2 a 9.6/10), and I'm currently looking forward to playing MGS3 (I'm planning to get a PS2 soon. The only systems I currently own are a PlayStation 1 and a high-end PC). MGS1 is 10 hours of pure gaming bliss!\n\n  My only regret is not playing through this game earlier in life.\n\n  Overall score: 9.8/10\n\n  I will now summarize this review into 5 words: You MUST play this game!", "summary": "If you've waited this long to play MGS, don't wait any longer!", "unixReviewTime": 1222560000}

(Though the dialouge can be a bit cheesy). The only thing I have to say against this game is the camera angle and graphics. I've been used to playing PS3 games with their amazing graphics, so when I saw this it came as a bit of a shock. I've played other PS1 games around the same year with better graphics, so I'm a bit surprised with how bad this games graphics were. But by no means does it take away from the experience of the game.\n\nThe camera angle, on the other hand, took away from the experience, only if a tiny bit. It gets realy annoying when you enter another section of a room and the camera jumps to another angle, when all you want to do is control it and move where you want it to.\n\nBut one thing I really loved about this game is how much you care for the characters. I found myself trying to get through the infuriating torture scene when you have to hammer the O button unfairly fast just to save Meryl. *SPOILER* I've also played the ending where you find Meryl dead, and it's just really upseting.

Metal Gear Solid was quite a fun and intriguing release and it brought a more cinematic telling into the stories and although short and plotwise it can get into philosophy-speak a bit too often (though at least it's easier to swallow than Sons of Liberty), it was still one of the more unique play experiences found on the console.\n\nStory: You play as Solid Snake who's sent to Shadow Moses Island in Alaska to rescue DARPA Chief Donald Anderson and ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker as well as stop the terrorist's plans on launching a nuke. But that's just the start of it as we get FOXHOUND members, special elite soldiers who went rogue, a big beast of a machine and Snake's own connection to the leader of the group.\n\nGraphics: Since this is the original Playstation, you kind of have to take everything at face value: they look blocky now and lack the clarity of Sons of Liberty or the huge polish of Snake Eater but it was on a lesser console so it makes sense. But at the time it was impressive with lots of cutscenes, done very movie-like and indeed the environments were well handled.\n\nSound/Music: Along with the Lunar series, the MGS series has always been prime examples of how voice acting should be done. Instead of overeager voices or just robotic delivery, it's very easy to get involved with the story when the actors do a great job at balancing the quieter moments with the more plot-based information. The music does a good job as well though it's used rather sparingly.\n\nGameplay: Unlike other games were it's encouraged to go crazy on your enemies, the MGS series rewards stealth and non-killing to progress. Use tranquilizer guns or knock out enemies, the object is to be seen as little as possible. Even then you have a huge assortment of goodies at your disposal that inexplicably can be stored in Snake's tiny pockets. From sniper rifles to 2 different kind of missile launchers, automatics and handguns and goggles, there's plenty to use should you get caught. Aiding your ability to not be seen is the radar where a blue cone represents your enemy's field of vision which you avoid though you can distract them by making noise such as knocking on walls.\n\nCutscenes are well-handled from FMV-types which detail nuclear histories and such while there's others which handle the in-game cinematics like meeting characters. But Snake also talks through the CODEC, a radio and video communication which shows a black screen, text and 2 character portraits and though it's handy to read all the heavy plot scenes, it feels strange for character moments. Get used to that ring too since you'll be hearing it a lot as you play the game. The other negative people might have is its length which doesn't really feel long and it's actually perfectly paced and it doesn't feel like the game got extended just for the sake of adding more stuff to do.\n\nAlthough we have the remake with the Twin Snakes, I felt the original is the best version and while graphically it shows its age, it's still an engrossing playthrough.", "summary": "One of the Playstation's best, period", "unixReviewTime": 1208390400}

MGS is one of those games that comes along once every console, where the developers, producers and screen writers all seem to be on the same page, and create a master-piece. This game was revolutionary, in the sense that it focused more on the concept of espionage, rather than the usual \"run n gun.\" I played this game back in 1998, when it was first released, and have been following the game ever since. This game made my jaw drop with the graphics it pushed out of the ps1, and the storyline is amazing. Theres love, hate, plot twists, dual endings and so much more that combine to make this game great. One thing I remember is the battle with Psycho Mantis; (a crazy military psychic)who knew every move you were going to do before you did it. At one point he tells you to \"put the controller down to see his true power\" and with a hardy yell, my controller vibrated right off the coffee table! Of course it was the rumble feature, but how unique is that? We were all tripped out on the greatness of this game, and the intelligence put into the storyline. This game is by far the best game on the ps1, and if you haven't played it yet, now its not too late. Get it, play it, and then buy the others for the PS2, Metal Gear -Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear- Snake Eater. If you got a PS3 be on the look out for Guns of the Patriots coming out on March 1 2008, its going to be amazing.", "summary": "Best game on the PS1 Console", "unixReviewTime": 1179878400}

I've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars (4.5 to be exact).  I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is, as many have already mentioned, being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar.  The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks.  No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating.  I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way!  The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I've ever experienced before.\n\nI originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting, that I felt the game deserved to be respected, and Konami deserved credit for making it.\n\nHowever, playing the game today for the first time in months, I don't know what happened. When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode, and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there (or walking towards me) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him. It was addicting. I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun, too. The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid.  Every single one of them is fun, not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one. I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments.  Hearing enemies talk while you're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE!\n\nI also love when everything is nice and quiet, and then you accidentally walk right by a guard.  When this happens, a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of \"Oops, my bad!\" because now the guard is chasing you around.  You now have to run for your life.  I didn't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun. This IS a really good game. I'm sorry for saying it was average last year. Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind.\n\nMetal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3.\n\nI especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're \"playing\" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami.\n\nSometimes the guards aren't as intelligent as you'd like them to be (you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by, without noticing you) and apparently none of them can see you if you're standing only a couple feet away, but you know, these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems.  I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time.\n\nI still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.\n\nEven though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations isn't really my thing, at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want (by pressing any one of the four main buttons, plus the Start button).  I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them.  I don't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form.  It's actually decent.  You see, my whole life I've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually \"playing a game\" and less time should be devoted to storyline segments (I'll make an exception for RPGs).  The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS.  Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay.\n\nWith changing times and technology, people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming.  Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators.\n\nI DO have one complaint- there doesn't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target, so YOU are forced to find and face the target.  For example, if a guard is located south/east of you, you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him.  You have to face him directly or he'll continue shooting at you until you're dead.  This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge.  This could have been fixed with one simple \"lock-on nearest target\" feature.\n\nSure, you have guns that can zoom in on a target, but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position (which changes the angle of the camera).  By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position, and believe me, you don't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you.  I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target (such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs).  That way it won't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me.\n\nBesides a bit of overall darkness, a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting, I have no other problems with the game.  These are really minor problems and it's easy for me to look past them.  A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict.  Metal Gear Solid is a classic game.  It just took me a while to see that.", "summary": "I was WRONG about this game", "unixReviewTime": 1154044800}

They all said the same thing, and I agreed with some of it. I'll be the first to admit that Metal Gear Solid is short. Skipping cut scenes, I can be the game in about 2 and a half hours now. I'll also admit that the graphics are dated, however for their time they were amazing! Sure, I'll even admit that some of the dialogue was cheesy.\n\nBut I will never agree that the plotline of Metal Gear Solid is stupid, slow, or senseless. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is a better story. Of all the movies I've watched, books I've read, and games I've played, I've never expierienced anything like Metal Gear Solid's storyline. Twists, turns, shocks, and surprises are all through it. Sure, there is a lot of watching, but it's worth it in my humble opinion.\n\nFor those of you who for some reason are unaware, Metal Gear Solid is about a \"hero\" named Solid Snake. He is sent in (despite retirement) to rescue two people from a nuclear disposal facility on an island called Shadow Moses. The place is under control by the group Snake used to work for, FOXHOUND. Leading this rag-tag bunch of freaks is Liquid Snake, a man with the exact same face as Solid.\n\nBut Liquid is not alone. Psycho Mantis is one of the game's most intriguing bosses. He is a telekenetic with a love for throwing furniture with his mind. The battle with him actually requires you to change your controller to another port so he can't dodge your bullets. Sniper Wolf is a beautiful but deadly assassin who's target becomes her obsession once she marks it. Vulcan Raven is a giant Shaman who loves heavy weaponry and can survive freezing temperatures with no problem. And then, there is Revolver. Good old Ocelot makes sure to cause you all kinds of trouble throughout the course of the game, including torturing you with electro-shock! And how could I forget Ninja? Although this mysterious villain is not with Liquid, he seems determined to slice and dice you! Oh yeah, and Decoy Octopus. But you won't know much about him until it's too late.\n\nBut you aren't alone. There are two people who are physcially there for you. One is Meryl, a red-headed babe who just so happens to be your colonel's neice. Then there is Hal Emmerich, also known as Otacon. This geeky hacker gets you out of a ton of sticky situations in this game. Even though they aren't actually there, the people you contact by Codec help you out bunches. The colonel, despite being quite shady, gives you a plethora of tips to get you out of bad spots. Mei Ling, a cute little Chinese girl, saves your game and fills your mind with interesting proverbs. \"Master\" McMiller is an interesting old friends of Snake's who knows a lot of about the Alaskan wildlife and wilderness. Then there is Deepthroat. This guy is quite mysterious, but very helpful. Oh, and Naomi. This sexy and sophisticated scientist is the reason for the technology that is keeping you warm in the cold climate of Alaska.\n\nThe things I've mentioned don't even scratch the surface of MGS's story, characters, and twists. Don't trust anybody. That is my best advice.\n\nGameplay? Amazing. You'll get use to the layout of the controls very quickly. Soon, you'll be quick reloding and popping around corners like a pro. You can shimmy walls, knock on them to distract guards, come up behind a guard and choke them until they pass out or just snap their neck. What about A.I? It isn't terrible. On Easy it's a joke. However the guards can see your footprints in the snow, and track you. They can also hear your footsteps on certain kind of terrain, and when they group up it can be scary.\n\nIt can make you laugh, cry, or piss your pants. Listen to naysayers if you please, but listen to me more! You cannot go wrong with Metal Gear Solid, unless you aren't an action gamer. It has lots of cinematics, old school graphics, and some cheesy dialouge...but those faults don't overshadow the amazing characters, storyline, and gameplay.

It will always have you on your toes, literally. I have seen many movies, and I can honestly say this game has a better storyline than most movies. Here is what you need to know..\n\nGraphics- 100/100 The graphics were top of the line when this game first came out, and even to this day they look great. There is so much detail to every aspect of the game, and even compared to most newer games, this game wins out. Back when I first played it in about early 2000 or so, the graphics were the best the playstation had to offer, and that's a year or so after this game came out, which is pretty astonishing. There is even a scene where Snake is in the girls bathroom, and there is a mirror which perfectly reflects everything. I mean, back when this game came out that was a pretty big feat both graphically and attention wise. Most games just don't pay the kind of attention this game does.\n\nSound- 100/100 Perfect. Just flawless. There isn't much of an actual soundtrack, but the music is incredibly atmospheric and will make you feel like you are Solid Snake, infiltrating a nuclear base. The voice-overs are the best I have ever seen in a video game. Solid Snakes voice over is perfect, and just about everyone elses fits their personality and there image. Otacon's fits him perfectly, so do Meryl's and Liquid Snake's.\n\nSeriously though, this game has incredible sound and has never been surpassed by any action game to date.\n\nGameplay- 100/100 I have heard people complain about the poor camera views limiting the gameplay, but in my opinion, the camera views perfectly fit this game and the game wouldn't be the same without them. Sure, it would have been nice to have a first person perspective while using the weapons, but it's all the same to me. I think it is perfectly fine having to shoot enemies in a third person view, and it works better with the type of graphics that it has. When you are spotted, enemies will storm in from all directions to stop you, something that seperates this game from all others. This game gives you good reason to want to play it safe, but still allows you you have some action packed fun as well, if you want to take a chance that is. Also, this game has an incredible storyline but doesn't throw it in your face all the time. MGS2 drags the storyline on eccesively and bores you with excruciatingly long cut scenes and codec conversations. I remember using the square button to skip most of the cut scenes in MGS2. The problem with MG2 is that the storyline is too complex for the good of the game. I mean, much of it is pointless grubble and the game bores you by making you listen to conversations about crap that doesn't apply necessarily to the main storyline, making it a waste of time. This game, however, truly has a wonderful , complex storyline that you will WANT to watch and listen to. Every conversation and cut scene adds to the game flawlessly, so you will probably never get bored, although I am sure you will find yourself reading the codec conversations manually instead of listening to the people talk, since they tend to talk rather slowly and take up a bit too much gameplay.\n\nOverall- 100/100 This game is as perfect as it gets, and I have beaten it at least 15 times, if not more. Even to this day it is a pleasure to play, and I don't think it will get old any time soon.", "summary": "Brilliant, possibly the best action game ever created...", "unixReviewTime": 1111536000}

Metal Gear Solid was a very hyped up game in 98' and lived up to the hype.  I simply loved this game.  Metal Gear Solid has bin called by man fans and gamesites as one of the best PS1 Action games.  I totally agree and I think it's not only the best Action game but also One of the best games ever created.  It has a brilliant story line which I won't bring up since You can find time to read other reviewers since they pretty much tell you.  The game is a stealth game.  It pretty old Stealth game Acctually, the game is about 7-8 years old.  I was one of many Fans to buy this amazing game when it first hit stores.  Metal Gear Solid earns its 5 for these things.  Story, Gameplay and Villans.  The villans in this game are awesome.  From the moment you get to the Ocelot fight to getting your hands on Rex You will love this game.  Metal Gear solid Has bin one of the most Popular Playstation games and has spawned sequals(ala MGS2 and now Mgs3)  And what makes Metal Gear Solid one of the best games is also the fact that Metal Gear Solid has one of the best Storylines in a game.  Sure there are some plot holes in the series but Kojima did that for us(the fans) to make our on Theories and to guess and what not once the next one comes out.  If you've had a Playstation for a loooong time and don't have Metal Gear Solid in your PS library Then I donno what the hell is wrong with you.\n\nMetal Gear solid Sums up to these things\n\nBest Story line in a game\n\nSome of the best Graphics scene on the PS1(yes it's extreamly out dated but I still love the graphics in this game as it was the best in it's time)\n\nGreat Stealth action\n\nAmazing Level desighn\n\nMy favorite....The boss battles(just awesome especially the finale with Rex)\n\nGood Replay value..\n\nCons\n\nNOTHING....\n\nwell I guess I should point out that this is a pretty short game.  The first time through for me(since I looked around alot)will be maybe 8-10 hours second time through should take 5 hours or less.  But that doesn't ruin the game at all\n\nThis game is a masterpiece, everything about it is amazing and it's even better then the remake(I thought it was)\n\nIt all comes down to Metal Gear Solid as one of the best Ps games ever and it totaly earns its...\n\n5 out of 5 stars....Superb\n\nLates...", "summary": "The best Playstation game ever", "unixReviewTime": 1102723200}

Solid Snake is my hero, and i wish he were a real person so i could meet him and get a picture of him a cardboard box.  this is another reason why i like the game and the rest of the series, the humor.  while funny, most of it still has a point. sure, it's funny to see a guy sneaking around under a box, but it's also very stealthy and strategic.  as long as you don't move while the enemy is watching, you're good to go.  using the box is like an ongoing game of red light green light.  except in this game you can pop out and break the guy's neck.  also, knocking on walls is sometimes funny, but all the time useful.  knock on a wall to lure an enemy into a mine you secretly placed near a truck.  there are countless ways to enjoy dispatching your enemies, even without the use of weapons.  leading them around circles with your footprints in the snow is also humorous.\n\nbut enough about the comedy, and onto the meat of the game.  the story. while not all convoluted (see also:  metal gear solid: sons of liberty.), the story still maintains a good conspiracy type theme involving the government and a rebel group of terrorists known as Foxhound.\n\nthe members of Foxhound are some of the most memorable in videogame history.  the first, Revolver Ocelot, a gunsling, six-shooting Soviet that sadly loses a hand during an encounter earlier on in the game.  Vulcan Raven, a giant and shaman, he wields a gigantic gatling gun and resides in a warehouse freezer where he talks to his fellow ravens.  Sniper Wolf, a sleek and sexy, well, sniper, that has a reputation for always getting her target.  Psycho Mantis, a war guinea pig and avid gas mask wearer that also has psychic and telekenetic abilities.  the leader of them all is Liquid Snake, Solid Snake's \"brother\".  he's pretty much just an arrogant, powerhungry jerk hell bent on world domination/ a good end boss to really get the urge to kill.  other key players include:  the legendary Gray Fox/the ninja/one of the coolest freakin' creations in all of videogame history.  his optic camo and razor sharp katana (a gun later in the game) are just too cool.  He slices up enemies like they're butter and looks cool as hell doing so.  he is by far, next to solid snake, the coolest character ever imagined.  but they wouldn't be nearly as cool if it weren't for the story behind it all, which i'm not going to get into, you'll have to buy the game if you want to know more about it.  there is also a woman in the game named Meryl, who is an army brat and snake's love interest, kinda.\n\nthere is also a VR training mission part to the game.  it is quite fun, especially if you have a very competitive relationship with a friend or family member that likes games.  you can easily lose hours tryin to shave off a tenth of a second off your opponents time.  my friend and i would spend entire days just playing the VR missions.  after we couldn't beat each other anymore, we called it a tie.  there is a \"technical wizard\" you can watch go through all the various stages to give you a better idea of how you can get the best possible time.  but if you are anywhere near as good as my friend and i got at the stages, this techinical wizard will look extremely slow and stupid.  man...those where the good old days.  and the greatest thing is, you don't unlock a damn thing for beating any of the missions, just more variants of the same, like doing them with weapons, stealth, cardboard box...oh well, it's still a great distraction.  and it's way better than the VR missions game that game out, but in that you get to be Gray Fox for a couple missions, which is amazing.  cloaking and slicing people to ribbons, sign me up!\n\nthe cinematics in this game, even by today's standards, are some of the most well crafted to date.  enemies are all introduced in an impressive manner and even scenes of pure information and dialogue are fun to watch (at least the first time).  the voice acting is superb and the whole thing comes off as something of movie-quality work.  this game isn't a classic for no reason.  check it out and you'll understand why.  and if you can't stand the blocky graphics of the psone, get the re-vamped Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, for the gamecube.  it's the same tale, with some minor added and changed stuff, but nothing major.  either way, it's well worth you money, and so cheap for such a masterpiece.  no one should be without a copy of this game.", "summary": "snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!", "unixReviewTime": 1100563200}

The game is dramatic to the max.\nBut not as dramatic as sons of liberty.  Meryl was an awsome character too.  Snake has feelings for her but he won't admit it and more complications occur.  The game is one of the best games I have ever experienced in my gaming time.  The BOSS battles were awsome.\nThe game is one of those games youll remember experiencing and the first time is the best.  The characters are all great and the voice acting is not even close to bad.  I won't spoil anymore for you but I also recomend getting TWIN SNAKES.\nI got that game the day it came out and it did not dissapoint\neven though I found some stuff to be better in the original than TWIN SNAKES.  For example: The final conflict between Snake and Ninja/gray fox wasn't as sad as I thought it would be in twin snakes.  The speech was more moving in the original.  But over all this game is great.

I purchased it ... at a local retailer and the thought 'if it sucks i'm not out much' went through my mind.  I brought it home and installed it not expecting much out of this game.  Once I started playing though I was blown away.  This is a great game in the spirit of Diablo 2 and Nox.  You start out as a revenant, a resurrected spirit with no recollection of your past.  You must fight an evil cult and rescue the king's daughter, at least I think he was a king, i didn't really pay much attention because the dialogue is annoying in this game.\nAside from the annoying dialogue, and it is very annoying, the rest of the game rocks.  The way spells are cast is interesting and different from normal games where scrolls are memorized or written in a magic book.  The melee combat is good because your character has 4 different attacks instead of the one slash attack in Diablo 2.  Granted he can't learn a whirlwind attack or leap attack but who cares?  That's not realistic anyway.\nThe graphics and sound are both very good.  The only problem is sometimes I have difficulties picking up items off the ground, especially if they are hidden behind the leaves of a tree.  Also, sometimes you will get stuck behind a rock or the edge of a fence line and it takes a bit to get unstuck, but you never remain there forever.\nI also like the way I can see enemies on my map so if my health is very low and I have no food or potions I can avoid them, making my way back to town.\nThis game is worth as much as $36.95.  I might have given it a few more dollars if it weren't for the annoying dialogue.", "summary": "Solid game, worth every penny ....", "unixReviewTime": 991526400}

Recent lower pricing (along with the long wait for the release of Baldur's Gate 2) saw me grabbing a copy, loading it up and setting off on a short, but immensely enjoyable quest. It turned out to be a great time filler.\nIn the single player mode, your character is Locke D'Averam, dead for 10,000 years but because of unique skills, brought back onto the mortal coil to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the head honcho of Misthaven, the main town on the island of Ahkuilon, by a mysterious magician with (surprise, surprise!) his own agenda.  During his quest, aspects of Locke's past gradually reveal themselves and his visions start making sense by the end.  Sounds like a poor man's \"Planescape: Torment\", you might think, but since nothing can compare to that epic, forget it and judge it on it's own merits.\nLikened by many to Diablo, this game is superior in that it actually has a reasonably compelling storyline (though badly voice acted) and the combat system is not your average hack'n'slash - you learn new battle techniques from the master as you advance.  The use of a game pad is strongly recommended, though I survived all the combat encounters by pounding the hell out of my keyboard while moving about with the mouse.  The scenery is beautifully rendered (the lighting is a real feature), and animation of Locke and his enemies is superb, though a tad repetitious - like the giant spiders getting stuck on the sword and having to be removed with obvious difficulty (hilarious the first time), the death gurgles of the ninja guys got old very quickly.\nThis is the only game I've played lately where you can carry everything you find - there don't seem to be any weight limits and there are millions of slots, especially once you have a few pouches which you really need to negotiate the huge inventory you end up with (I had about 10 full suits of armour at the end - I was too scared to sell any in case I needed their special properties).  Even though the armourer and weapon smith promise bigger and better equipment, you actually find the best stuff during the quest, though you need to buy some stuff to start off with.  Unlike many other games, except at the very beginning, I always had enough cash to buy any potions, etc. that I needed.  In fact, at the (rather abrupt) end, I had about 60 unused potions of various sorts, and about $100,000.  Also, your character is usually strong enough and well enough equipped to survive most encounters pretty easily.  I found the fact that he wasn't constantly being killed quite refreshing.  None of the puzzles were too taxing, though I had to redo one level for the want of one vial.\nEven though the price was reduced, it was still fractionally more than I paid for Planescape: Torment, or for that matter, Baldur's Gate, each of which provided rich and stimulating entertainment for a couple of months.  I spent exactly a week getting to the end of Revenant, and since I'd been having such fun, I was totally unprepared for it.  Remember how disappointing the end of Diablo was?  Ditto for Revenant - the final encounter was quite easy for my impressively armoured, well-armed and richly provisioned character and the whole thing was quickly wrapped up in a movie sequence.  It left me feeling the story was only half told and that the developers just suddenly decided to get it to some sort of conclusion and out in the shops, while they got on with something else.  I wish they'd just gone on with the next chapter - despite any shortcomings mentioned above, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  This is the game to play when you're half concentrating on something else - in my case, LIVE coverage of the Sydney Olympics.", "summary": "Short, easy, but surprisingly enjoyable!", "unixReviewTime": 972432000}

Whee.\nMagic spell creation is novel, but quickly  become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when you're trying  like a madman (or madwoman) to heal yourself, but can't get the runes  lined-up in time.\nAnd even the graphics, which are nice, are loaded with  bugs.

Why do they always ruin every game box with that stupid green bar on the left telling people its a greatest hits.

I was playing Metal Gear Solid 2 the other day and realized that it can never compare with what this game has achieved.\nYou are Snake, the operative who must go in a nuclear testing facility held by terrorists. Snake goes in by stealth, and must fight numerous villians. All the villians in this game are extremely well done with voice acting and great personalitys. I can't find big complaints at all with the game.\nThe game is so good that they are making the remake for Game Cube, and possibly other systems. Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. Anyways, the game has music that probably for me basically tops final fantasy 7, just because it is original and fits the mood perfectly. Every character has perfect voice and personalitys, so the voice acting never gets old. I've played the game like 8 times, and I loved it every minute.\nThe bad point is the backtracking, but it is really short and is always for a reason. You backtrack usually with a goal in mind. And you will usually backtrack like a mofo on halloween. Meaning really fast to get your candy. And every time you do it(like 3 times in the game) you will get to listen to juicy codec calls that unravel more story bits and liven it up.\nI love calling Cambell(who is a great character) on the codec to see what he has to say. It always seems to be different and intellectual. He can also give you hints, and the other characters on your codec play major roles.\nThe best part about this game is the story. Honestly, RPG's have the best storys, but this game can top almost any rpg in story. We learn about 2 snakes, and how they believe things. Liquid Snake.... he talks about being a flawed snake and such, and whenever he talks it's always interesting to the point where I want to hear it every game.\nWith story comes philosophy. This isn't the matrix where we have a man called morpheous talk about philosophy in some crazy underground rave. This is Solid Snake and others being honest. Solid Snake has some of the best views on life. He's like a rebel without a cause. His lines are thought provoking and are probably things that someone could base their life off of. Live life is probably the best message he tells and can give, and this philosophy is rare in video games today.\nThe fighting is cool, and bosses offer challenges and fun. I would reccomend this game to anyone. You will get your moneys worth from this game, and I hope you enjoy it. But one more thing, lets not forget what you must do. Buy the game for playstation not computer. On computer they like changed the skins around or so ive seen in screenshots. Solid Snake looks alot younger, and alot less vigilante like and stuff.

Let me explain myself:\n  It's a third person action/adventure game, that requires you to utilize stealth to survive.  As Solid Snake, a lone warrior, you have to single-handedly infiltrate Shadow Moses Island, a base recently taken over by terrorists to develop a nuclear capable walking robot, codenamed Metal Gear Rex.  Your job is to make sure Rex never launches by any means necessary.\n  It sounds like a typical third person action game, but there's so much more to this game.\n  First off, the plot is flawless.  Hands down the most intricate, well thought out, and moving plot I've seen in any thriller movie ever made.\n  Your main enemy, the enemy most commonly seen in the game, is the Genome soldier.  The Genome soldier is a member of a genetically engineered army.  If you stay out of sight, you'll never have to have a physical encounter with one of these guys.\n  However, the boss fights cannot be avoided, and thus, it's a darn good thing they're so enjoyable.  Bosses range from normal human beings with dreams of revenge to individuals with slightly supernatural powers, which adds an interesting twist to the game.  Every boss is fighting for their own perosnal reasons, and their own motives.\n  The game will take roughly twelve hours to complete the first run through without a strategy guide.  I advise you to listen to all the Codec conversations and watch all the cinematics because this is where the game truly shines.  It's story.  With six times the lenght of the average Hollywood thriller, the story is developed much more, and the characters are fleshed out far better than in any film I can think of.\n  This game has my highest recommendation.", "summary": "Proof that Videogames Need to be Taken More Seriously", "unixReviewTime": 1056585600}

Not only was Metal Gear Solid a good game, it was a great game.  Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games (if not the best game) on the Playstation and it should take its place as one of the top games of all time.\nWhile previous Metal Gear games had suggested that stealth was the way to go, and other games had used the concept, I had never seen stealth developed as well as it was in Metal Gear Solid.  It was not only a good idea, it was the only way to go.  You needed to avoid enemies (as best you could) to be able to make it through the game.  When you killed an enemy, you had to do it in a way that nobody saw you or heard you.  Metal Gear Solid is called a Tactical Espionage game, and it means just that.  You are a spy and spies should not be seen or heard.\nLike the other Metal Gear games, you play as Solid Snake (now the legendary Solid Snake).  It is your mission to infiltrate the Shadow Moses Island in Alaska, rescue a hostage and see what is going on.  From the moment that you begin the game, what you know is being tested and your place in the story is being escalated quickly.

I had such a high expectation for the sequel because the first one was such a GREAT game.\n  When there were hypes and information of MGS, i wasn't interested in it at all because i'm a old schooler, just into 2D games.  However, when i had a chance to play a demo at Toy'R'Us, i knew i had to get this game for no matter what.  So i ended up getting it the day it came out and was so amazed at the masterpiece.\n  Story line, game play, graphic, music, and fun factor.. all A-rated.  The graphic was the best from that time where everything's based with color green.  The amount of detail was almost insane to the point where you can literally see mice running around.  The appearance of night vision/thermo goggle gave a whole new look.  The music was there to really raise this game to another height because the strongest point of this game is its story line, presented through cut scenes.  When these emotional/shocking cut scenes are coupled with A-rated music, it really brings out the emotion and shock very effectively.  It really brought vibration function to a new standard and believe me, time to time it makes fun out of itself for being a game, which didn't kill the game but rather added more spice to the game.  Each character, whether pro/antagonist, there were strong character development though it might be a short cut scene.  However, it was more than GOOD enough, you could literally be sympathic with the characters.  Still, my favorite character Psycho Mantis,, oh man,, you just gotta play and see \",,it feels nice,,\"\n  The biggest difference between this game and the second one is that the first one knew when and where to put the cut scenes.  The first one was very controlled yet it was just right for the gamers to really appreciate the story flow, whereas in the second one, it's just wasted use of ineffective cut scenes here and there, not to mention ridiculous codec dialogues (which literally not only stop from continuing its legacy, but killed it).  Another biggest difference has to be the ending.  The ending for the first one was really, REALLY rewarding, i absolutely had this sense of 'fulfilled, completed, satisfied, reward'  You will know what i mean.  The second one, umm,,, no comment.\n  Well, what can i say,,  i could find no flaws from this very game (well, there's no such thing as 'perfect' game, there were little bit of flaw with A.I., but trust me, it's really nothing when you are being overwhelmed by this game).  Like this editor from EGM said, this game is about experience.  Absolutely, it is.  I have played variety of games, import, domestic, and used to work as a game tester: when i have to pick one game for the best of the best, I PICK METAL GEAR SOLID WITHOUT ANY HEGITATION.\nPLEASE, DO ME A FAVOR AND DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS GEM.

TR1 and TR2 were the best in terms of story, pacing and action. The CG sequences were cooler too.  I hate to say it, but I'm disappointed in this game. TOO SLOW! The levels go on forever, and there's nothing to keep your interest. Ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you, or some scorpians, but that's not enough to keep you interested.\nThe other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated. I got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels.  The beginning of the game shows promise with young Lara, and there is a very cool level where Lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnot.\nI don't know what I can recommend instead of this one, but I would say rent it or get it for cheap like $5 or less used or new.

I especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the action/adventure element and increased pace of the second one.  This series starts off promisingly enough.  Outside of a mandatory (groan) training level, the game eases you into the tried-and-true Tomb Raider gameplay we all have grown to love.  The environments are large and exciting, the puzzles clever.  Exploration is fun and rewarding, and progress is logical.  For the first 6 or 7 hours.  The challenge level really picks up after the VERY neat train level, and in fact starts to become downright maddening.  Do we really have to backtrack for 3 hours just to find 7 scattered items required to make it through to the next level?  Things get flat-out obnoxious at the Chambers Of Tulun and the Trenches.  This area goes something like this: rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room.  Go to the Citadel Gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister.  Return to the Chambers and go to the Trenches.  Obtain the nitrous oxide feeder.  Return to the Chambers of Tulun to obtain the roof key.  Go back to the Trenches to get to the Street Bazaar.  Get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the Trenches.  And so on and so on and so on.  Is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary?  I really enjoy the high challenge level of the Tomb Raider series, but this is ridiculous.  If I didn't have a strategy guide with me, I wouldn't have made it to the Citadel (which is where I am right now).  This game is loads of fun for about 20 or 25 levels; afterwards, it becomes a chore to play.  The graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first Tomb Raider, and the legendary level design has regressed considerably.  Many spots feel cheap, rather than challenging.  Control, while still functional, still isn't perfect, and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nerve-wracking.  If you miss and survive, then you have to make another series of jumps, which can take another 10 minutes just to get back to where you originally were.  I could go on and on, but this game is just too much.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart.\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nThe transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game.\n\nStory- 10/10\nYou are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates.\n\nSound- 7/10\nThe music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune.\n\nGameplay- 10/10\nYou play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability.\n\nDifficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)\nSince this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.\n\nOverall- 10/10\nDespite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.", "summary": "My Favorite Game or All Time", "unixReviewTime": 1209859200}

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow!\n\nI have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.\n\nI'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.\n\nI really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head.\n\nThat led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily.\n\nMost of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE.\n\nYou see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!\n\nI think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.\n\nYou have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.\n\nThe music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game.\n\nListen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder...\n\nOnce again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.\n\nThe play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.\n\nA trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.\n\nI find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.\n\nJust running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.

N", "reviewText": "To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.\n\nMega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.\n\nLegends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.\n\nThe pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.\n\nSo with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter).\n\nThe other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.\n\nIn the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.", "summary": "A good game with lots of heart...", "unixReviewTime": 1118275200}

The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.\n\nThe controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.\n\nIn my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.", "summary": "Take to the Skies", "unixReviewTime": 1205712000}

You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.

Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course.\n\nNow, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.\n\nThe movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.\n\nOverall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3.

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.\nBreath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.\nSound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing.\nHowever, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.\nWith all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems.\nSure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy.\nThe random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot.\nThe plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her.\nThe plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits.\nThe  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes.\nThere  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat.\nI've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality.

Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.\nAs far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation.\nAs far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.\nAs far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it.\nThe graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.\nAnd finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental.

Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.\nSolid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.\n\nTekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.\n\nFor modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.\n\nThe combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).\n\nOverall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME.

But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me.

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.\n\nTomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.\n\nScattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.\nThe last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.\n\nThis game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.\n\nFor classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business.

It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game.\n\nThe graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc.\n\nThe controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use.\n\nThe graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail.\n\nAnother thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms.\n\nThe music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too.\n\nThis game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well.\n\nIf getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find.\n\nIf you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.\n\nHighly recommend, 5 stars.", "summary": "One of the greatest RPG's ever, maybe the greatest ever", "unixReviewTime": 1351555200}

The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D? So I'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5.", "summary": "Still great", "unixReviewTime": 1187568000}

Erickson", "reviewText": "OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all.\n\nMuch like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something.\n\nIt's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden \"secrets,\" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous \"medi-paks.\"\n\nPlay this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.", "summary": "The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff", "unixReviewTime": 1100563200}

I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every \"Tomb Raider\" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did!

Convery", "reviewText": "If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that.\nTomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious.\nThe game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well.\nThere are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played.\nSo why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.\nEIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!", "summary": "Dear Eidos,", "unixReviewTime": 1074124800}

In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time.\nThe story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end.\nThe game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now!\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\nAll in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...", "summary": "Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!", "unixReviewTime": 1031011200}

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.\nThe scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect.\nI would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.

Jongeling", "reviewText": "Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.\n\nThere are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.\n\nThe game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.\n\nYou eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.\n\nAll in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic.

The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.\n\nAt first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.\n\nMuch like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.

What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\nCons:\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\n(Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints.\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\n\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.\nAll in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.\n\nCONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).\n\nPROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.\n\nI think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

The game claims to provide so much more content, however, the \"scam\" is, that you don't get that content with the game. You need to buy it. If you win races you will get a message saying \"YAY! You can now purchase your new car from the online store!!!\"\n\nOMG REALLY??? I CAN SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I ALREADY PAID FOR??? NO WAI!!!!\n\nBut overall, if you don't mind playing with the same default cars all the time, it's a pretty fun game. I really only play online mode, which allows you to race against other people. The computer on this game is WAY to easy so single player isn't any fun. You could drive backwords and still beat the computer.", "summary": "Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1339200000}

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.\n\nThis is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.\n\nPROS:\n-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects\n-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive\n-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling\n-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins\n-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)\n-3D support!\n\nCONS:\n-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard\n-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)\n-Essentially requires some sort of analog input\n-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing\n\nOther thoughts:\n-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!\n-LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks.\n-If you want to win, employ a Fin!", "summary": "An overlooked gem in the Forza/GT treasure trove", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200}

I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.\nI have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...\nDirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.\n\nAs I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing graphics\n- Amazing physics\n- Challenging but entertaining races\n\nCons:\n- Gymkhana\n- Interface\n\nWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.\nI saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!\nRacing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.\n\nNow, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.\n\nConclusion:\nAs far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.\nIf you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!\nIn spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.", "summary": "A 5 stars winner!", "unixReviewTime": 1318982400}

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.\nI am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.", "summary": "awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!", "unixReviewTime": 1315958400}

The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.\n\nMy only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.\n\nI really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal.

For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.\n\nBefore I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.\n\nTo begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.\n\nThere are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.\n\nThe second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.\n\nThere are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.\n\nThe set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.\n\nNevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.", "summary": "A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400}

I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.\n\nAs other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.\n\nThe guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.\n\nI do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.\n\nFirst, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.\n\nSecond, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.\n\nThird (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)\n\nFinally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!", "summary": "Almost perfect guide set!", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400}

Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version.\nThe controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon.\nIf there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch.

From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really \"snazzy\" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a \"Streets of Rage\" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:\n\n  Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.\n\n  Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5\n\n  Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)\n\n  Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.

Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes.

Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed.\n\nI can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically.\n\nThe first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game.\n\nSo there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.", "summary": "Still holds up", "unixReviewTime": 1045526400}

I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!\n\nAfter the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\n\nTomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...", "summary": "The Best PlayStation Game Of All Time!", "unixReviewTime": 1032998400}

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).", "summary": "I need this and the second one", "unixReviewTime": 1150502400}

So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches?

Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one.\nFirstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block.\nThe inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging.\nStill, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.\n\nWar Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.\n\nThe opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.\n\nOnce you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.\n\nChallenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.\n\nOverall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead", "summary": "Boring Game!", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800}

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.\n\nYou know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.\n\nYou know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.\n\nBefore WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.\n\nThe very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.\n\nWWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.\n\nWWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.\n\nI tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.\n\nIf only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.", "summary": "the absolute low point", "unixReviewTime": 1152748800}

Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!", "summary": "RPGs, you gotta love em'", "unixReviewTime": 968457600}

Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me.\n\nI recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.\n\nOverall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.", "summary": "Very Fun Game", "unixReviewTime": 1366675200}

This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.\n\nOther features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to \"buy\" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!!

Instead, it was more like being one of those \"other agents\" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue.\nFans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.

The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :)\nOnce you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week.\nThe rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that.\nThe game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore.\nIn the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.", "summary": "good game", "unixReviewTime": 1062720000}

Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played.\n\nStory: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire!\n\nGameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.\n\nSound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots.\n\nGraphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.\n\nReplay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed.\n\nI figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system.\n\nThat being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it.\n\nAs you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around!\n\nAnother aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life.\n\nThe maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much.\n\nAside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.

The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy.

The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.\n\nAllow me to explain :\n\nWeapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.\n\nNew Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.\n\nThe introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.\n\n(((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.\n\nEnemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*\n\nThe levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.\n\nAll in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability.\n\nIf you can find this cheap, get it.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.\n\nThere is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.", "summary": "Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1031788800}

After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.\nThe look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.\nAs stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.\nThe game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them.\nIt's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.", "summary": "I just love blasting TIE'S....", "unixReviewTime": 1006128000}

First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!\n\nI loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category.\n\nSound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.\n\nControl: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.\n\nFun: 8.5/10.

Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.\n  This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.\n\nPrior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.\n\nThen came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.\n\nI won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before.\n\nThe world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.\n\nMateria System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it.\n\nCharacters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.\n\nIn conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself.\nMy advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world.\nIn the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.

I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do.\n\nReplayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)\n\nGameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun)\n\nStory: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING)\n\nGraphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version)\n\nControls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do)\n\nSound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)\n\nAddictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game)\n\nThe best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.

Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have.\n\nEspecially if you're already dead.\n\nThat's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?).\n\nManny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client.\n\nAnd that's when he gets in over his head.\n\nThe story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake.\n\nYes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.

I cannot even think or read about it without getting giddy.  Another Zelda game just came out-- Skyward Sword-- and reviewers have been raving about its story and art work and graphics, etc, etc, etc. But it still doesn't compare to Ocarina of Time. Not even close. I have played many, many games, and there is no question, this is still the best game ever.  No one here is lying.  It deserves every one of those endless 5-stars. There is a massive chasm separating this game from every other game fighting for second place. No other game even comes close.\nWhy? In order of importance, least to greatest:\n1) Graphics.  With consoles now like the 360 sporting games like Halo: Reach, and the PS3 with the Uncharted series, there is some serious competition for artwork and graphics.  But the Ocarina is still more mesmerizing.  Yes, the landscape does not extend forever into the distance, and yes, the polygons making up the characters are obvious, but the lines created are more pleasing than any Zelda since, and the colors blend and contrast perfectly.  From Mount Doom to lake Hylia, the imaginary world and its inhabitants draw you in, and within a few deceptively short hours, you cannot look away. \"Graphics,\" as thought of today, with rocks crumbling and wood splintering when bullets strike, do not exist.  But they don't need to.  Even the most obbsessed lover of graphics will forget their obsession as they get lost in this games beautiful, open world.  If you love the huge open maps of Fable 2, or the sprawling cities of Assassin's Creed, you will love this.\n2) Controls.  Games these days usually let you customize your button layout. This is not nescesarry with Ocarina of Time.  The N64 controller fits any hand perfectly, and the buttons you want are always right where you want them to be.  It is very easy to learn and (except for its sibling Majora's Mask), easier to use than any other game. No crazy button combos to memorize.  No wiggling of the joystick to perform random tasks.  Just simple, logical, purposeful, buttons.  Perhaps in the future it will change, but even after Skyward Sword, I, and many other people still prefer the buttons to the Wii mote. If you like playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl with a gamecube controller rather than the nunchuck, you will definetly prefer this. And unlike Mario64, the cammera follows you perfectly.\n3) Puzzles.  This is not a sword hacking game, though there is enough to satisfy the first person shooters.  There are many very simple puzzles, and many frustratingly hard puzzles, but none so hard that you rip out the cartridge and throw it against the wall. And if you ever get stumped, there are plenty of side quests and mini games to help you upgrade your equipment or simply vent. The game takes time to figure out, even if that means just getting your bearings in a huge maze, but there is a simple satisfaction to moving on, especially when you restart and pass effortlessly through the dungeons you've already decrypted straight to the boss. If you liked Myst, you will love this game.\n4)Story.  Most importantly story.  The first time I read the Narnia series, I was almost bored by its simplicity until the Last Battle, at which time I finally started to recognize the symbolism and see the depth between the lines.  The Ocarina of Time is likewise a simple story, but there is so much depth in the admittedly simple dialogue.  From the opening flames, to the closing courtyard, the game draws you in.  You become a part of Zelda's world.  You come to trust, love, despise, or hate almost every character in the game.  Even the chickens and dogs.  There is a great romance between Zelda and Link, hiding just beneath the surface.  Anything else? You want it, this game has it. Tension. Passion. Action. Adventure. Mystery. Comedy. Heroism. Deceit. Sacrifice.  Even ghosts, mummies, and various undead for all you horror fans.  By the time you finish the game, you have made real connections, for better or worse, with every character in the game.  And (spoiler alert) when Zelda turns and see's young Link walking up behind her in her garden, it is so maddeningly bittersweet you don't know whether to smile or break down and cry.  There is a certain Pale Rider feel, as you see everyone you've helped rejoicing at their freedom from the evil King Gannondorf, and yet knowing that your's is not the happily ever after you spent 7 years fighting for.  It is emotionally beautiful.  The perfect echo to the human heart.\nI cannot stress how highly I reccomend this game.  It is 2012, and it is still listed as the greatest game of all time on every major site.  On Amazon, a new copy is currently selling for $700. It is far and away the best game ever made.  It is the best reason there is to still buy an N64.  If you still do not have this game, buy one now.  Even if you are part of the 0.01% who decides against it, you will easily make all your money back at resale.  But honestly, you will never sell it.  It will grow old on your shelf with honor and dignity as long as the silicone inside it lasts. And maybe even a bit thereafter.", "summary": "Still best game EVER after more than 13 years.", "unixReviewTime": 1330560000}

There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword!\n\nAnother side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.\n\nThe ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get)\n\nEven the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn't bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious \"Mask of Truth\". Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up \"Majoras' Mask\".\n\nBut of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn't bother to complete, but completing it does have it's merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.\n\nThe bosses are great. I won't go into great detail, but I've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.\n\nThe temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning. It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple, and the open courtyard.\n\nThe music is top-notch even by today's standards. Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.\n\nThere is even a sweet element of sadness in Link's lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.\n\nThe ability to customize adult Link's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.\n\nIn short, this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart.", "summary": "Link's Greatest Adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400}

Fann", "reviewText": "Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG (there is debate about this, and some argue Zelda is it's own genre) with a combination of puzzles, fighting, and racing. Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT (which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube). I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time, it's that good of a game.\n\nGraphics:\nFor the time period, Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles. It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like. If you grew up on newer systems and PC's, these graphics will look \"blocky\" to you, but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics. Still, if you want a \"retro\" video game experience, the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.\n\nStory:\nThe Zelda story is perfect for a video game, as the basic premise is always the same. Link, a young boy (or young man in newer games), is the reincarnated hero of time. He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.\n\nZelda OCT molds the \"Zelda Story\" into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time. The game's puzzles become progressively more difficult, culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple. The story combines several races (Hylians, Kokiri, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora) seamlessly into one large kingdom. The enemies are varied and interesting as well. The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate, complete with twists and shocks, time-travel, and genocide. Time affects the characters, and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails. The story details are amazingly deep, to the point that pictures on someone's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character. I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the \"back story\" by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes. The main story is also amazing, with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe. It's truly a master's greatest work.\n\nGame Play:\nThe 64 had a simple controller for fun game play. There are only a few buttons, A, B, Z, C-pad, R1, L1, joystick, and the D-pad. The D-pad isn't needed in Zelda 64. This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations. Although B always attacks and A always does \"an action\", the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do. Depending on the way your character is moving, and whether or not an item is targeted, Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks (vertical cut, horizontal slash, diagonal slash, spin attack, thrust, and jump attacks). Despite the fact that B, Z, and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves, Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired. Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response!\n\nIn addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls (something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on) the game play is interesting and varied. Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword, each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons. Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield, but he also get's access to a sling shot and deku seeds, boomerang, hook shot, bow and arrows, bombs, deku sticks, deku nuts, and two impressive two-handed weapons: a hammer and a sword. These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.\n\nAlthough the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons, the game is further varied by magic. Link can wield three types of hand magic, as well as three types of magic arrows. This adds another level of monster fighting, where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.\n\nApart from the impressive array of weapons, Link also packs a varied wardrobe. The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion (I mean, he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap, so he obviously doesn't care about his looks), so each piece has a specific use. You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits. Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields, and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.\n\nWait, there's still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.\n\nSummary:\nZelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game. The characters are interesting, with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover. The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play. The bosses are challenging, requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.\n\nFinal Note:\nIf the 64 is too retro for you, Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics. However, the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 (understandably) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great. Additionally, there is a 3DS version, but I haven't played that so I really can't comment.", "summary": "My Favorite Game of All Time", "unixReviewTime": 1320019200}

You can play it by yourself, but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game, just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again, there are several mini games, known as battle games, to choose from.

The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes. The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once. Plus I didn't have a controller pak. Then came the day I bought it again for my n64, nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64. The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels. Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing. I was always able to hold as many as they would let me. Such as doom, Turok, South park, Armorines, perfect dark, etc. Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps. Sure they have better graphics and frame rate. But they are all the same to be honest. Emulators sucks ass I don't care if its rgb or not. But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps's are all I got. But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much. To me it's the best looking system and has the best looking games. Turok tops it all! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of. Turok 2 is on pc and n64. The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate. Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out. In my honest opinion I wouldn't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all. Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it. The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is. They are smart and fight one another (really fun to watch) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well. The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different. My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow, Shotgun, War-blade, Razor-wind, Cerebral bore, Plasma Rifle, Mag-60, Grenade launcher, the kick ass Charge Rifle (ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS), Firestorm Cannon (like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding), Nuke, Flamethrower (The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64), and the torpedo Launcher (because you can go through water faster). Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard, sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass. Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that, that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound. The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning (I run that in low-res) and is just as good as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, The world is not enough, and Turok Rage wars. Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well. Armorines (a amazing game! Uniquely different yet just as awesome), and South Park (not many liked this game but to me it's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park!... The multiplayer is good to just don't go above 2 players.) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game. Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed. They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so. Making their games unique. Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did. Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything. Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series. I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game (except turok 3, its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap). So Turok 2 is amazing! if you want to try it get it now! on n64 or even on PC! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels! Turok is the greatest fps try them all! (your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game, the first fps on n64. Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play. Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection. Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns. Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer. Turok PC,360,ps3 I played it on 360, Runs on the Unreal Engine (which is bad ass) a great game with good weapons (Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate, I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music, awesome multiplayer [if anyone is on] and a good campaign). These are the Turok games! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable. Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it! And bring a few friends over! It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fans.", "summary": "Turok 2 My childhood game!!!! Relives and Tops ALL!", "unixReviewTime": 1342224000}

But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one.  If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through.  But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.\n\nYou will be required to light beacons, find keys, and rescue children.  Again, Level 1 isn't so bad, but Levels 2-6 are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost.  The map you're given sucks.  And to make matters worse, you can't leave or quit levels once you've selected them.\n\nBut if you're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online, then \"Turok 2\" will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000.  The combat is still a blast (although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes).  The presentation is sharp.  And the Turok world is still very unique from today's overload of military/war shooters.\n\n\"Turok 2\" was one of the N64's most critically-acclaimed titles for the console, rightfully so.

The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played.  It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week.  Somehow it just wouldn't die, no matter how hard we tried.\nAt first, it just seemed so standard and bland.  Playing muliplayer for the first time, I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level.  soon, somehow, something clicked, and me and my friends  ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight.  Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session, we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me.  Thus we coined the \"God\" mode, and we played this variant to death in the coming months.\nIt didn't end there.  We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches.  We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen, LAN-type mode, covering up other player's screens so we wouldn't know where the other players were.  We playedthe Team mode constantly, refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship.  Fed up with auto-aiming, we turned it off and further honed our skills.  I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep.  Proximity mines soon became an addiction.  We pushed the game to its limits, learning that we could move the ammo boxes, shields, and guns around by shooting them, thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games.  We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that weren't intended for the final version, as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players.  We discovered a code that turned one player invisible, and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen.\nBasically, it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities.  It was a revolution for first-person shooters, and so many have overlooked this fact.  It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts, over 20 weapons to choose from, realistic glass, shooting out of lights, and bullet holes, and for its time fairly revolutionary AI.  All in all, it was an experience that defined video games for me, and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experience.", "summary": "A complete revolution", "unixReviewTime": 1062460800}

Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon, especially in the way of graphics. With the expansion pak, graphics had 'almost' a Playstation 2 quality to them. It's something that showed with this game. It showed in the textures of the environments, the details of the architecture, lighting effects and other eye candy. The game was also bigger and better than any other game, with the exception of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in it's 32 meg cartridge. As you've probably read in the courtesy review, it's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime. While I don't know about that, personally, as I hadn't checked where I stand within the game..one thing I do know is it's one lengthy meaty game to sink your teeth(playtime) into.\n\nWhile Turok 2: Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rare's Goldeneye during it's release, Turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection.

Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations.\n\nIt's difficult to call any game \"perfect.\" No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.\n\nAdd to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now.\n\nHands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The \"Z\" button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that.\n\nIf you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.\n\nFinally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.\n\nIn short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.", "summary": "Buried Gold on the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1041292800}

It was like Mortal Kombat, except in a shooting-game. Blood everywhere, amazing enemies and weapons, and a good, good time. And I'll admit this; I don't actully play the Turok games. No, I'm sorry, I don't. It's not that their hard, or boring, but I don't play them...well, not without the cheats at least. As soon as I find out a new Turok game's coming, I get on the internet, go to Happypuppy.com, and find the Master Cheat. Yeah, it's pretty low, but it's fun to go in these blood-soaked shooter games. And the second one is no exception. I played this game without cheats for a few hours, made up my mind, and decided it was great, and would be even better with cheats.\nHalf an hour later, I came back with the Master cheat in my hand, which is \"BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND\", or, if you break it down, \"BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND\". Within minutes, I had an amazing arsenal, all maps, invincibility, and more by my side. The weapons...well, let's just say the first Turok can't touch them. You have the usual knife and bow and arrow, pistol, shotgun, and the rest, but you now also have a nuke, pod layer (which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact), a machine gun (as the first had, but this one's much better), the Cerebrial Bore (the most gory weapon of all. It launches out a little ball, and it goes straight for the enemies head. When it gets there, it starts sucking and draining blood form their head, then, after 5 second, it explodes, and takes the enemies head with it), my personal favorite, the Razor Wind (a shield with sharp edges on it. You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it's path, then come right back to you. It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at; the head, the legs, and the arms), and another physical weapon, the War Blade. The name says it all.\nOverall, this game is a vast improvement, and is the best yet (but that might change as soon as I play \"Evolution\").

They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.\n  Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.\n  I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.\n  Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.\n  The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.\n  The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.\n  So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.\n\n  THE BADS OF THE GAME\n  There are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.\n  At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.\n  If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.\n  The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.\n  The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.\n  The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.\n\n  Now, for the GOODS of this game.\n  GOODS\n  Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.\n  It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.\n  You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.\n  This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.\n  There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.\n  The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.\n  The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.\n  At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.\n  The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!\n  This game is excellent.

Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore? Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation2 and X-Box and Gamecube owners, \"I know it's an old system, but this game is the reason I still own it\"? Yes, and that game is called \"Golden Eye 007\".\nIt's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan \"Bond\" movies would become an undeniable classic. But that's exactly what \"Golden Eye\" is. Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay, while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players. Thankfully, \"Golden Eye\" is the diamond in the rough. It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination. Moving Bond, James Bond is as easy as breathing, and the shooting system is just as simple. Even with the horrible N64 controller, a player can learn how to play \"Golden Eye\" on the first or second try. And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI. Of course, because of the N64's difficult-to-program cartridge format, some things had to be sacrificed, like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot. But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.\nGraphically, \"Golden Eye 007\" was a marvel to look at...when it was first released. Nowadays, when compared to games like \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" for the PS2 and \"Dead or Alive 3\" for the X-Box, \"Golden Eye\" looks like a SNES game. Because cartridges are limited in space, textures can be bland, character models look blocky, and detail is kept to a passable minimum. But anyone who doesn't care about graphics, as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent, shouldn't have any trouble with \"Golden Eye\".\nSoundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game, but it's still good. Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it, at least to a certain extent. And voices, while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs, suit the game well. It would've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters, but the limitations of the cartridge format doesn't help this area much.\nAll in all, \"Golden Eye\" is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming. While the N64 is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released (alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy), it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced. \"Golden Eye\" is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game, but many non-FPS gamers also found it very enjoyable. While later great first-person shooters like the N64's \"Perfect Dark\" and the recent X-Box million-seller \"Halo\" presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot, \"Golden Eye\" will forever be remembered as the first-person shoot for the masses.\nIf you need a reason to keep your N64, this is it!", "summary": "One of the defining first-person shooters in existence!", "unixReviewTime": 1018396800}

The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.\nIn a word, \"Goldeneye\" is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.\nThe graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action. The controls, usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller, are easy to manage here. After a while it becomes like second nature.\nFor parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence.

Klein", "reviewText": "After checking GameSpot's (author's note: this was originally posted exclusively on GameSpot.com) and a few user reviews, I absolutely had to throw my two cents in. I couldn't help but laugh when I read the introduction of \"Even with all its bells and whistles, Mario Kart 64 is very likely to disappoint you after about a week.\"\n\nWhen I picked up this game initially, my thoughts were \"SWEET! A new Super Mario Kart!\" I, unfortunately, never had an SNES of my own, so my fixes came in the form of time at my friend's house.\n\nThis game is absolutely spectacular in every way. Yes, I do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that it's possible to clinch a Gold medal in a circuit (4 races) after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races. However, other than these minor spots, I find it to be flawless. Everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great. There is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this, with not only the up to four player split-screen, but the track ghosts as well. Track ghosts are saved data of your best race (single player only) on a course. The game saves not only your time but your entire race. When you race against your ghost, you can actually compare yourself second-by-second on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer.\n\nThe items are what really make multiplayer fun, though. I've had many a time where I have something such as a ghost (which lets you steal and item and makes you invisible/invincible) while my friend had a lightning bolt (shrinks all opponents) and it's a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first. To me, however, there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent (especially if it's a friend instead of the computer) with a green shell (a shell that fires straight out, as opposed to the red homing shells) as he's about to cross the finish line to win, not just the race, but the circuit as well. And, yes, I actually did that to a friend of mine. Talk about bragging rights.\n\nUp to this point, I have kept (or at least tried to keep) retro-rating out of this review and I was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a 9 because I'm stingy with giving out perfect 10's. If I had rated this game when it first came out, it would probably be rated somewhere around 9.7 to 9.9. However, there is one reason, and one reason only, that I still own my N64 -- and that is to play Mario Kart 64 ... a decade later. (Note: I can't even say that about Zelda: OoT or GoldenEye.) That, in itself, I think warrants the move up to the perfect 10 rating. ... I guess this pretty much means that I'll have to give Super Mario Kart a 10 as well. I guess we'll see when I finally get it on Virtual Console. (For those of you who ask \"Virtual Console?

But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness, so I guess that character was okay. Zeldo had this tall white-haired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard. Inca might have been a man too though...I'm not sure.  She looked kinda like my aunt Helga.\n\nThe Link character was really cool!  Link wears white tights, a green toga, and had a grappling hook device! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around! You begin the game playing Link's little kid brother, which kinda sucked.  I can't pwn Goombas with a little midget (Goombas are these big skeleton guys).  I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan, after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland (maybe they have another game about that part).\n\nBut later you get to play Link, who is an adult elf with a pointy nose. He has the Trueforce of Braveness, so that means he is very brave. He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures! I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates?  Later on, Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow! I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks. He just goes \"Ugh! Hiyah! AUGHHHHHH!\" and stuff.\nI think he might be a cannibal (or vampire) too, because he eats hearts to gain health. There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it's time to feed.\n\nYou pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with. But they look really big, so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets? And if you don't pick the rublees up soon enough, they begin flashing and disappear! I guess they're like...big holograms or something, like in Star Wars.  Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks? I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that.\n\nThere are these fish people named Zurros. They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man! I think it was the Zurro king's pet and he lost it. But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba's stomach, so it's kinda annoying.\n\nThen there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains! They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain. It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you!  Holy ****!\n\nThat evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves. They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach. But they don't have any men in their race, so I don't understand how there are so many Garundos? Maybe some of them are trannies, like Zeldo.  I think Glammondwarf might be one. He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs.\n\nSooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters. I think it's supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit. It's such a huge place! It takes forever to ride across it on Link's horse, Ramona! That's right! You get a horse! Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch. So I guess Link is kinda a thief. Maybe he's really one of those Garundo thieves? He does kinda look like a girl.  But he's not a ginger, so I'm not sure.\n\nAaaanyway....play this Bassoon of Time game! It is full of so much WIN!  I hope I didn't give too much of it away!

He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time, the storyline was really exciting, and there is a lot of stuff to collect.

And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better.\n\nTo do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost.

(the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own.\n\nThis version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons.

It's rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you can't help but say \"okay I'ma try one more time then I'm turning it off\" and still be playing a couple of hours later.\nThe Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and wouldn't do things right as far as the puzzles went.  I loved the Forest Temple as a kid.  The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do.  The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach, hitting switches, and killing enemies.  The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them.  lol\nI don't remember much else about the game since it's been a while since I had time to play it.

Twilight Princess, although very in depth, was easy and Majora's Mask was the hardest but only because I kept running out of time when doing certain tasks.

Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun, but added a lot too. The gameplay is much more enhanced, the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.\nLike the SNES version, this game includes 3 modes of play: GP (Grand Prix), Battle, and Time Trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup Star Cup, or Special Cup (which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses) in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc is the easiest, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging. There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game, there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course. In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them, snowmen that will blow up if you hit them, and many other obstacles in different courses.\nIn Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip. You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them. Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players. This mode is a lot of fun, especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.\nIn Time Trial mode you race in any of 15+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.\nThe controls for Mario Kart 64 are very simple and easy to master, and the music and sound effects are great as well.\nIf you want a great racing game for your N64, I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart 64.", "summary": "One of the best racing games on the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1021075200}

This game was one of the first I got for the N64, and it is one of my favorites today. As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N64 days, it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it's era. The sound is moderate, but sound isn't a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game.\n  A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit, this game was certainly watched before it's release date, as it stormed into the N64 world and took many fans (as you can see from it's very high review in many chances) right away. It was considered as a very high class game then, and now too. Many of the N64 owners today have one in their hands, and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs.\n  This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in. The size of a typical game back then, but with the technical advancements of some of the games today. The graphics are very good, as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly. The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time.  The sound is entertaining for a while, and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses, showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts.\n  The gameplay is also great. You may pick one of 8 characters to race with. On a small go - cart, you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first. There are many modes. You can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode, where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points. A vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 (or 3) in a single race. There is also a battle mode, which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins.\n  The items in the game play a big part. Some will boost your speed, while some are used to slow down enemies. Some steal enemies items, and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible. Most of the however, are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down. In battle, it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy.\n  The characters are the typical mario game characters:  Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, DK, and Bowser. They should all come in handy sometime in the game, and it should be fun to test them all.\n  OVerall, this game is great for having fun. I reccommend it to any one. Great for technology too.

If you  run the story correctly on all of them in the end your basically the town  pimp.\nAs far as game play goes when entering the dungeon you are always  brought down to level 1 and only able to take 5 items inside. This is an  annoying thing. Your monsters do not loose levels but as they survive they  loose magic and leave way to fast. Also to keep your weapons in poor shape  early you well have problems with rust traps, which lower their quality.  Also there are items they raise the quality of the weapon and shield (only  equipment you wear) threw the game called sands. A good thing to remember  is gold swords do not rust, neither do diamond or mirror shields. Without  knowing that the game can get pretty boring faster. The game is very  repetitive. You end up doing the same thing over and over again while you  get to the deeper levels of the dungeon again and again.

They are not poorly done sprites but I have seen higher quality.  There are many different looking monsters and every couple floors the  dungeon's floor takes a new appearance.

He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forest,the Great Deku Tree,is dying from a curse. The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda. Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop Ganon,King of the Gerudos,from entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifoce,a divine relic. Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time. Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganon,who entered the Sacred Realm. Link awakens seven years later,and after discovering he is now an adult,meets Rauru the Sage of Light. According to Rauru,the only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages.

And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history.

One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the \"Collector's Edition\" (\"Zelda 64 a Remake?\" and and one on the \"Regular\" edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.\n\nMike London, 9-9-2012\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis commentary on \"Ocarina of Time\" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007\n\nArticle 1: Does \"Zelda 64\" really live up to all the hype?\n\n[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?\n\nOne reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!\n\nThen, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.\n\nAfter five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.\n\n[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]\n\nWhat did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.\n\n[Spoiler Finished]\n\nOthers say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That's one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.\n\nBut what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:\n  1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).\n  2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.\n\nAll other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.\n\nThen we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn't believe they did that!  Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.\n\nNow, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.\n\n[May 9, 1999.  An article originally written for NintendoLand.com.  I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2).  It will have to be edited.  Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArticle 2:\n[Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.]\n\nZelda 64 a Remake?\n\n[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]\n\nAfter playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.\n\nLets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.\n\nIn the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.\n\nOkay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!\n\nAnother issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )\n\nThe real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:\n\nA Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 64\n\n1. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.\n\n2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.\n\n3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.\n\n4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.\nWhen he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.\n\n5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.\n\n6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same.\n\n7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.\n\n8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.\n\n9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.\n\n10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.\n\n11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.\n\n12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker.\n\n13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.\n\n14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.\n\n15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.\n\n16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.\n\nAs you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.\n\n*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.", "summary": "Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?", "unixReviewTime": 1193961600}

Nay, I will go as far as to say perfect. Even if you haven't grown up with the Zelda series, you're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable. It's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary, and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time.\n\nThe story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut. Staying true to past games, you start off with no items or weapons. You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link, and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest. Upon taking your first steps outside, you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest. While you search the area for a sword, you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment. Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items, you head for the Great Deku Tree, accompanied by your faerie friend Navi. After completing this first dungeon, the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest, thus setting the story in motion.\n\nThe graphics of this game are fantastic for its time. You can now journey through a fully navigable 3D map. The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting, be it a forest village, a watery temple, a haunted underground maze, or the inside of a giant fish's belly. The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore. The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well.\n\nI absolutely love the controls in this game. Everything is pretty intuitive: the A Button is used to execute actions, the B Button swings your sword, and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play. You're able to roll and jump, swim and climb, block attacks, stab, and build up power for swing attacks. But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability. This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object. Moreover, this button will focus the camera directly behind Link, allowing you to have control over your point of view. To this day, I compare games' camera controls to Ocarina of Time, often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability. A great addition to your supply of character controls.\n\nThe story itself builds upon previous games in the series, for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals. As always, there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels, some that are familiar and some that are new to this title. What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time. You begin the story as a child, growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones. When you travel into the future, the world has become darker and your missions more challenging. There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests. The multitude of puzzles, games, and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining. The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich, enjoyable plot, furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid.\n\nAnd the game would not be complete without sound. Again, Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here. The sounds that Link makes when he fights, moves, and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable. The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in. Likewise, the soundtrack is just as appropriate. Each level has a different musical score, and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings. Also, some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games, transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic, yet new. The ocarina songs are appealing as well, adding another interesting component to the gameplay. Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack, and even today I still enjoy listening to it.\n\nAll in all, this game is truly a classic, and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series. From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genre.", "summary": "Extraordinary!

I've owned this game for a good 6 years and it's just extraordinary and fun, but at the same time educational. In this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are. So in other words, it's a magical adventure game.\n\nThe graphics are actually good (for it's time) and the gameplay is easy to get used to. The controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and I can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game. In my opinion it's the best Zelda game so far.\n\nNow I will tell you the beginning of the Story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game.\n\nAs a young baby boy, your mother was killed by an evil person. Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest. This is a place where people never grow up and aren't allowed to leave the forest. They're called the Kokiri. But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule?\n\nIf you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special. Like I said, it's a definite Classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end!

The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard) are unbelievable.  Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game.

Both games have been remade for the GameCube, and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version. The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME\nThis game started out as you as the \"Hero of Time\". You were the only forest child without a fairy, and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you. When you go to the Deku Tree, he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time, and a bunch of other crap like that.\n\nSound and Music: 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world, and the ocarina songs are very good. 100% credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games, these are some great songs. The only problem is you can't shut it off. Sometimes it gets annoying, and it doesn't help if you are stuck on a level for hours.\n\nGraphics: 2004: 4.0/10.0 1998: 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible. If this game was released today, everyone would laugh. Back in 1998, these graphics were the best out there. But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.\n\nDifficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.\n\nGameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASK\nThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf's in this game, because it revolves around Majora's Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.\n\nSound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.\n\nGraphics: Same As Ocarina of Time\n\nDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn't mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.\n\nGameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games.

Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons, castles, villages, volcanoes, etc... Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle, and once explored, you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location. This makes areas more accessible, and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible, due to the fact that you're not endessly travelling through pre-explored ares. Backtracking is an important feature of OOT, due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths. Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges. The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors. Thus, pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game. This is compounded, when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword. This is a special sword which, upon claiming, makes you and the world age by seven years, and by doing the reverse, putting the sword back in it's mold, makes you and the world 7 years younger. The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different. The future is controlled by evil, whereas the past is controled by good. Needless to say, your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf. However, in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world.\n\nA main part of this game is the ocarina of time. Depending on what tune you play, the ocarina will turn night in to day, make it rain, open secret doors, or make blocks disappear, amoung other things.  This adds an important layer to the game, for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress. For instance, after spending hours wondering what to do, the idea could suddenly hit you, \"Should I play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the waterfall?\" If successful, the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself, thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling. The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history. In fact, only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT.\n\nBy the time Zelda: OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect. Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary, you were fustrated when you died, you were delighted when you succeeded. Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it's those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed...  Unfortunetly, since OOT, games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them isn't there anymore.", "summary": "Fly Free Bird", "unixReviewTime": 1094342400}

Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.\n- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.\n- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.\n- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.\nOverall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time).

You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.\nIn the end, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time makes the cut.

Weidman", "reviewText": "A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you don't already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now.

What can I say. As I'm writing this review, the popular  consoles right now are ps2, gamecube, and xbox. I have all of those. Yet no game on any of those systems are better than this. This is probably the best zelda ever(I have yet to buy the one for gamecube). Deciding between this and Majora's mask is a tough call, but I think this one gives a little more gametime.\n  How should I begin to describe this game? It's deep, engrossing, and the graphics are spetacular for a N64. Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this, but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay, music, and theme. The story is old, but hey, it's a classic formula. Why change it? What would Zelda be without dungeons? This is one of the few 3rd person games I've played with great controls. The z-targeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert, and maneuverable Link. The music fits the moods perfectly, from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods, it's great. Buy it, it's worth your money, and it's probably the best game ever for N64.", "summary": "I LOVE THIS GAME!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1049414400}

Lots visually diverse landscapes and effects, intriguing gameplay and endless oppotunities for exploration within the framework of the game. No boring moments here! The horse is certainly a nice touch (being a bit of a horse fanatic myself). Provides a fairly lifelike representation of horse riding. Nice soundtrack, and the interactive music play was quite satisfying. All in all a well designed game.

It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists, new terrain and interesting characters.\nIf you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title \"The Wind Waker\" and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of \"Ocarina of Time\" for Game Cube. Not just the good old \"Ocarina of Time,\" made famous on N64, but also an enhanced version called \"Master Quest.\" Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.\nHappy Hunting.", "summary": "What are you waiting for?", "unixReviewTime": 1043971200}
